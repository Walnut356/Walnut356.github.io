seen this question come up a few times on r/ssbm and while I've given hand-wavey answers before, I find myself in a good place to answer more rigorously now. We can break this question down to more basic ones: \"how many bytes of replay data correspond to a single frame of gameplay?\" and \"how many bytes in the replay are unrelated to frames?\". From there, we can estimate a duration by simply translating the 16.667ms per frame to minutes and seconds.\n\nFor the analysis, we'll be using the replay parser I wrote in Rust. Replays do store their duration - both in their total frame count, and directly - so we'll easily be able to check our work. We'll be using my current netplay replays folder which contains my most recent ~1000 replays, several of which were filtered out for unimportant reasons.\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n\nAfter loading these into the database, a quick query gives us the total duration of all of the games: 155,336,180ms. Or, in a less disgusting unit, ~43 hours and 9 minutes. Accounting for the filtered replays, the total file size is 3,682,219,473 bytes or ~3.43GiB.\nWhat exactly is in a replay file?#\n\nThis is both an easy and a difficult question to answer. While we could directly inspect the assembly code that exports the replay data or the .slp file itself in a hex editor, there's a much easier way: a file specification maintained by the slippi and slippi-adjacent devs. The spec helpfully lists the hexadecimal byte offsets of each field in each subsection. The values are not encoded or padded in any way, so simply adding the byte-length of the last field to the offset of the last field gives us the total size:\nEvent:Size:\nPayloads30\nGame Start761\nPre-Frame65\nPost-Frame85\nGame End7\nFrame Start13\nItem Update45\nFrame Bookend9\nGecko Listuhh...\n\nThe metadata event at the end doesn't have a guaranteed size, but it's roughly 250 bytes.\nIt's also worth noting that these sizes are specifically for replays of version 3.16.0. As new versions come out and add new fields, events can be larger. It follows that events in older replays have smaller events. We can't extract the replay version without parsing the replay, but the file creation date and/or default file name (which contains the replay's creation date) can be used as a proxy to that information. I manually compiled the release dates of the replay file versions by walking the git history of the replay recording asm file, a list is available here\nSo now we know what's in a replay file, but that doesn't tell us what's in a replay file. For that, we need to bust out the hex editor:\n\n...\n\nAt the top we see the header, a 15 byte sequence that marks the beginning of a .slp file, which we can add on to our non-frame data total. Next we can see the command byte for the Event Payloads (0x35), followed by the command byte for the Game Start event (0x36). The next thing we see though isn't the start of the first frame of data as might be expected, it's event code 0x10 which corresponds to the Message Splitter. The layout and implementation are a bit confusing, so I'll gloss over the specifics. Long story short this contains all of the gecko codes used when the replay was recorded. As I understand it, this exists to prevent playback desyncs, especially in spectator mode. Unfortunately for us it means we're going to have to formalize the fact that our playtime estimate will be an estimate, not an exact match.\nSee, when you play a match against someone online, each of your dolphin instances generates a replay file. As many of you probably know, there are a handful of \"netplay safe\" gecko codes out there - codes that can be added by an individual, but won't desync if their opponent doesn't have it. These can change from game to game as the player toggles them on or off. Also, there is no \"sharing\" of gecko codes, and no \"canonical\" list of gecko codes for that game, thus each dolphin instance records the gecko codes that it had enabled at the time. That means 2 (or more via broadcasting) replay files of the same game are not guaranteed to be identical. Keep that in mind, as it will come up again later.\nThis means that, at best, we can only guess at how large people's gecko codes will be. There are some limits to how small and large the gecko codes section can be, but for now, we'll just assume everyone uses the same ones I do: the required and recommended set, as well as Flash Red on Failed L-Cancel.\nMy parser stores offsets of each event as an intermediate step, so we can pull the offset of the first pre-frame event, subtract out the non-gecko event sizes, and we get a gecko code size of 56,124 bytes. The game-end and metadata events also occur once per game (assuming no bugs). That means that, for this replay, ~56,374 bytes do not contribute to the duration.\nWe can multiply this by the total number of replays and subtract it out from the total byte count of the files, leaving us with ~3,623,139,521 bytes of pure frame data\nFrame data#\n\nThe naive solution is to just divide the remaining bytes by the size of frame start + pre frame + post frame + frame end (172 bytes). That gets us 21,064,764 frames, which we can multiply by 16.667 to get 351,086,432ms, or ~97.5 hours, which slightly more than double the actual time.\nOne issue stands out immediately: frame start and frame end events only happen once per frame, whereas pre- and post-frame events happen once per character per frame. Note how there are 2 pre-frames (0x37) and 2 post-frames (0x38) in this single span from one frame start (0x3A) to another:\n\nBecause these are generated per character, there will sometimes be more than 2 pre/post frame events per frame start/end. Nana generates her own frame events when she's alive, and doubles games will generate events for everyone who is alive. In my case, I don't have any doubles replays and I don't think there's a statistically significant enough number of ice climbers games in my replay set for it to matter. That means each 16.667ms, it should be exactly (13 + 9 + (65 * 2) + (85 * 2)) = 322 bytes. That would mean we have ~11,251,986 frames, which is 187,536,852ms, or ~52 hours. It's fairly close to our goal of 43 hours, but still about 20% too high.\nItem Frames#\n\nItems are a bit of a can of worms. \"Item\" in this context is more a game engine term than a colloquial one. We'd normally think of items as being projectiles - falco's laser, turnips, pills. In engine terms though, an item is basically any non-player, non-stage, non-ui entity. Using the items tab of stats dash, we can see what (and how many) items falco spawned in a single game:\n\nHuh. Not just are lasers items, but also falco's gun itself as well as the trail left behind by his side B. Some characters have lots of items - most of GnW's attacks involve an item - some characters have basically none. There's also some extra weirdness with things like samus's charge shot, which count as items during the charging animation, even though they're not \"active\" and able to deal damage. Things like marth's sword that are permanently attached to his player model don't count, but then shine doesn't count when it seems like maybe it should. I've been surprised more than a few times by what does and doesn't count as an item.\nEither way, that means that there isn't a perfect \"generalized\" method to predict how many item frames are present in a game. Knowing what characters are in it helps, but we've restricted ourselves to file size as our only source of info so at best we could only guess by an additional proxy guess of the average character distribution (which also assumes that you have roughly the same set length vs, say, game and watch that you do vs fox which likely isn't true). It's still probably worth checking if item frames occupy a significant fraction of my game time though which is pretty simple:\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n\n5,229,553 * 45 = 235,329,885 bytes. Removing that from our total gives us 3,387,809,636 bytes, which is 10,521,148 frames, 175,355,973ms, or ~48.71 hours. At least for someone who plays falco 90% of the time. Our estimate is still about 13% too high though.\nToo many frames#\n\n13% too high is kind of a lot. The remaining data is purely frame data, and it's not being thrown off by items or characters generating extra frames. So why do we have so much extra data?\nWhen I built the parser, I compared the output to the py-slippi parser which I had previously verified as accurate, and I found that the outputs didn't match. The data from the first bit of the replay seemed fine, but later in the replay some things appeared to be happening \"too early\". The data looked \"valid\", it was just in the wrong location in the parsed data. I agonized a bit over how I was handling offsets, but the end-game data was correct as well. After some time stepping through my parser with a debugger and comparing the output to dolphin playing back the replay, I wrote a quick test that should have occurred to me from the start - do these parsers end up with the same total number of frames?\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n\nAh. Shit.\nAs many of you probably know, rollback netplay works by guessing your opponent's inputs when they arrive too late, then re-simulating the previous few frames once the accurate inputs finally arrive. What you may not know is that the code that generates the replay is written in assembly and is called directly by the engine's main loop. That means when the game re-simulates, it calls the recording code again and records those re-simulated frames. This is a good thing, it means that the \"canonical\" game exists within the replay file. The bad news is that there's no handling for \"cleaning up\" those rollback'd frames (and it's generally good that they're left in for debugging purposes) and my parser was treating them just like any other frame. Py-slippi has special handling for \"finalized\" frames - and the slippi file spec even mentions it in the frame end event.  For compatibility reasons, I don't rely on the frame end event, and I didn't have any special handling. As a result, my parser's frames were drifting apart from \"reality\" because rollback'd frames were sneaking in. Solving that was fairly easy, but what does this mean for estimating playtime?\nAll replay files will have extra \"garbage\" data that doesn't count towards playtime. How much \"garbage\" data? Depends on how bad your connection was as well as how often the engine mis-predicted inputs. It's worth noting that because the engine is re-simulating full frames, all the above issues (Nana, items, doubles) apply to each rollback'd frame. Remember when I said that 2 replay files of the same aren't guaranteed to be identical? That's true for this too. The rollback'd frames in each replay will very likely be different between the two replays because your opponent's client has to re-simulate via your inputs and you have to re-simulate via theirs; one client may guess wrong at the same time that the other guesses right.\nAll hope isn't lost though. Matchmaking typically makes sure pings aren't too ridiculous between players. Even when it can't, most players won't play those games out. That means, in general, the number of rollback frames should be pretty low. Finding out how many is pretty simple, just compare the total number of frames in the replay to the amount of \"valid\" frames:\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n\nPercentCount\n0148\n0.01-9.99575\n10.00-19.99120\n20.00-29.9989\n30.00-39.99102\n40.00-49.9912\n&gt;502\n\nThe vast majority of replays were less than 10% rollback'd data, and the total number of rollback'd frames is ~10.2%. If we remove this data from our total we are left with 3,042,081,134 bytes. Converting this to time as above leaves us with 9,447,457 frames and a playtime of 157,460,765ms or ~43.74 hours. That's a difference of only 35 minutes compared to our expected time! We got there by cheating a little, but we've established some important invariants and some decent guesses for things that aren't guaranteed. In this instance, items + rollbacks accounted for ~20% of replay data, and the rest can be accounted for via file spec guarantees. 20% isn't a bad number to start guessing with\nThere are a few other things that could affect the replay size, but involve incredibly rare bugs that cause events to be duplicated or missing.\nThe test#\n\nI have ~63GiB of replays dating back to 2020, so for this test I'll combine everything we've learned above into a simple formula and apply it to my replay data from 2022. One thing worth mentioning is the slippi versions at that time. 2022 had 4 major versions, but 3 of them were released in January/February. Most of the year was played on 3.12.0, with a solid few months on both 3.13.0 and 3.14.0. Thankfully, the size of the pre-, post-, and item-frame events are all the same on all of those versions. There's a few minor differences in some of the \"once per file\" fields, but since metadata and gecko codes are already estimates, it shouldn't matter too much. If I was building this more robustly, I'd have it dynamically alter the byte counts based on file dates, but that's not necessary for this test.\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n\nPlaytime (ms)Playtime (hours)\nGuess703700160195.5\nActual703206555195.3\nDiff493605.14\n\nWell well well, that's a difference of only 8 minutes, a difference of ~0.07%. Using only the file size, the number of files, and a little bit of investigation into a file format. I'd say that's a success. There's a few asterisks, but they can mainly be boiled down to the 0.8 scalar in the formula. If you play a different character or have better/worse connections on average, that number might need to be fiddled with.\nIs it practical? Uh... kinda. Opening a bunch of file handles and doing a handful of math operations is WAY faster than parsing all of the replays - especially if you aren't using a compiled parser (which are still bottlenecked by disk read speed, even when only partially parsing files). I think most slippi-adjacent apps are already parsing replays for other purposes though, so there's not really anything gained over just pulling it straight from the parsed file.\nStill, neat.\n","id":"https://walnut356.github.io/posts/estimate-playtime/","title":"Can you estimate playtime from replay folder size?"},"https://walnut356.github.io/posts/language-documentation/":{"body":"Seriously, is there a good reason for this? I feel like I'm going crazy because almost every language doc I've looked at is legitimately awful in a bunch of obvious ways. It's not uncommon to see third party libraries updated by a single person that are better structured, more thorough, with better layouts than the official documentation upheld by the language team itself.\n\nI can feel the rant calling to me like the green goblin mask, but to keep things snappy before I get into that, let me put some guidelines here. If your language docs do not have the following features, you should very seriously consider rewriting them:\n\nA canonical language documentation written for real human beings (really wish I didn't have to include this)\nDocs themselves should be versioned, so you do not have to sift through information that doesn't apply to the version you care about\nA reference section that contains the language specification (syntax, operator precedence, keywords, etc.)\nAn individual page for each standard library class or built in type\n\nClass and method descriptions should answer at least the first 2, but preferably all 3 of the following questions: What does this do (effect)? How does it do it (internal implementation)? Why would I want it to (use-case, comparison to similar methods, etc.)?\n\nLink directly to the source code of the internal implementation. If your language implementation is closed-source, shame on you.\n\n\nThat page must be as uncluttered as possible\nThat page must contain (not link to) every method, and the descriptions of those methods, that can be called by that class, preferably including all inherited functions.\n\nMost methods should have at least 1 example\nThere should be a sidebar or equivalent that contains all the method names in alphabetical order for easy searching and jumping\n\n\nCode examples should be at least lightly syntax highlighted\nexamples, descriptions, and function signatures should link internally as much as possible\nnon-cryptic names, or at least like... tell me what your 8 byte contraction expands to\n\n\nPreferably on a publicly accessible website, styled in a way that doesn't make my eyes bleed (dark mode option), and that responds appropriately to at least both full screen (16:9) and half screen (8:9) sizes\nA search function that isn't just lmgtfy?????? Are we for real???\n\nOkay clearly I can't hold back the rant any more. Read at your own peril.\nSeriously, cppreference straight up taking you to duckduckgo when using the search box is fucked. I cannot believe it still works like that. The blog you are currently reading has client-side search and I'm just some guy. That's not to imply that I wrote the search functionality myself, rather that if I can find out it exists and slot it into my site, they should be able to as well.\nJust Copy Rust#\n\nPlease god.\nI don't care how much you despise the language or refuse to learn it, you have to admit that Rust has put a lot of effort into the developer experience. It is the only language I've tried whose whole ecosystem feels modern and like it respects my time. Almost every other language has configuration hell, or shitty package managers (or NO package managers), or slow/barely functional/confusing IDE plugins, or non-existent onboarding, or... Look, I've got a lot of opinions on this. I'll try to stay on topic though.\nJust look at this:\n\nOh man, that looks pretty good. Look at the tasteful, left-aligned, width-bounded main text. Look the tactful use of vertical whitespace. Look at the distinct headers and comfortable text size. Look at the visually-distinct sidebar that never distracts from the main body text. Look at the font-colors chosen with such intention - high-contrast, near-white for plain text, low-contrast grey for the less-important \"stable since\" version number, vivid orange for the links, with a darker background for code-links. There's even a nice highlight when linking directly to a section of a page\nI'm not much of a front-end guy; maybe this isn't that impressive. After the horrors I've seen, it looks like art.\nBut does it also resize properly? In 2024? You bet your ass it does.\n\n\"Okay but I don't like the color-scheme\" you might say, \"It's not offensive, but it's a little dark/bright for me\"\nDon't worry, there's a whole-ass options menu with BOTH a lighter AND darker theme than the default\n\n\n\nLook at how many links there are just in the description of the standard library alone. There's also hidden, bonus links. Clicking the logo in the top right corner will bring you back to this root page from anywhere in the docs. Lets click the link on Vec&lt;T&gt; and check it out:\n\nIt gets even better when looking at the methods themselves\n\nLook at the level of detail. Everything in the rust docs looks like this, and I hardly ever come away with questions. And even if I did, the eagle-eyed among you may have noticed that \"Source\" button in the top right corner. Clicking on that brings us to this page:\n\nIs that... is that the source code of .drain, directly linked from the docs and available offline? Even if the docs aren't specific enough about how things work internally, I can just go look at how they work internally with a single click? Absolutely incredible. My only complaint is that this is the one section of the docs that does not handle half-width correctly.\nAnyway, lets talk about search. I'm sure you saw the box up there. Before we take that baby for a spin, I'd like to point out that it's not just \"search\", it's search with convenience features:\n\nHoly fuck.\nLets try a search:\n\n\nJust Works™\nFilter by crate\nSearch results by name, by functions that have an argument of that type, and by functions that return that type\nDOESN'T REDIRECT YOU TO DUCKDUCKGO\n\nTo sum up: rust docs are very close to perfect.\nWant to know the kicker? Every single library uploaded to rust's package manager has one of these websites auto-generated for it, containing all the doc comments from the library.\n\nThere's even an extra dropdown menu for crate metadata and access to older versions of the documentation\n\nThis is what I mean when I say rust feels like modern programming. Things you usually don't care about are unobtrusive, have low-contrast colors, or are otherwise hidden away. Things you do care about are obvious, convenient, descriptive, easy to read, and customizable. None of this should be groundbreaking.\nIt is not impossible to have docs that I enjoy reading. Unfortunately, the industry standard seems to be somewhere between \"outright offensive\" and \"a handful of glaring flaws\".\nHall of Shame#\n\nThis isn't meant to be exhaustive. It consists of languages that I've used, as well as Java and Go as a \"control group\". For what it's worth, I also spent some time poking around the docs for Zig, Odin, PHP, OCaml, and Ruby and found similar issues with all of them.\nPython#\n\nPython does not have individual pages for its built in types, thus looking for the float documentation does not lead to the python docs when google searching it:\n\nUnless you scroll down, which provides a link to inherent floating point limitations, and the CPython internal representation of floats. Neither of which tell you what methods you can call on a float.\n\nContrast this with rust:\n\nFirst 3 links are official documentation, one for each bit-width of float, and another to the rust onboarding book that describes rust's built in data-types more informally. Python does have an equivalent section of a page, but it doesn't show up when you search for \"python float\", as it lumps int, float, and complex together which turns the SEO into SE-No (sorry). Also the links to int, float and complex on that page don't link on to the class documentation, they link to the built in type-casting functions. Why.\nMost of the documentation is layed out like this, and it makes it excruciating to find anything. You constantly need to be thinking \"what other related things could this be grouped with\" rather than just looking for what you want. It doesn't end up degrading the internal search performance too much, but the internal search has a few issues of its own. It takes entire headers and sorts those alphabetically, so it ends up with unintuitive results like this, where the shorter exact-match dict should really be above ast.dict:\n\nPython also makes no effort to explain the internal implementation or semantics of most methods. It's sort of understandable for a language like Python, but I do remember lots of frustration and trips to CPython's source code. It also seems silly to me that the parts of CPython that are written in Python (i.e. most of the standard lib) don't link to the source code.\nC##\n\nHey look, a site that cannot handle both window sizes properly. The (pretty terrible) nav-pane, which I'll cover in a moment, disappears completely in half-width view. The burger menu in the top left opens up the site-wide nav-menu which is useless. The tiny little 3 dot menu in the top right corner opens up the nav-pane that people actually want, but only after an additional click on \"Table of Contents\" because why bother making it easy or convenient.\n\n\nAnd oh boy the table of contents menu. Ick.\n\nWhy does it load with the module I'm in scrolled halfway off screen? Why even include other modules in the first place? It forces them to nest the menus, which makes it harder to read. If I wanted things in other modules, I would go to the other module's page (assuming it was easy to get there from a centralized location or the search feature). Also, all the expand-os for the module I'm in are minimized by default, requiring even more clicks to find what I'm looking for.\nThat's not all - did you notice that there's two search icons? One in the ToC and the other on the main page. I'm going to look up add because I want to know how to use the List method that lets me put things in the list. Here's using the main-page search:\n\nhuh... that looks suspiciously like cppreference's duckduckgo redirect, but more subtle. It's still obviously on Microsoft's page, but it looks like they've scraped the search results from a real search engine, pulled only the ones from their URL and then pasted them in the search results. The only thing that would make it more likely is if Microsoft owned and operated a search engine meant to compete with the likes of google and duckduckgo...\nAlso, these results are wack. They're not sorted or filtered in any discernable way, and there are no sort options. I ran this search from a page within /dotnet/api/, but some of the results on the first page are from /powershell/ and /javascript/ sections. I don't mind that they're there at all, but they should be further down the list, or the filters should be set to only show results from the /dotnet/ section by default when I search from the /dotnet/ section.\nThe ToC search is much much worse. I'm going to once again search for add, from the system.collections.generic.list page:\n\nSo I guess we're just populating partial matches before full matches? Weird. Except... hold on... I scrolled down the whole list and List.Add is not on it. Are we for real? Are we not prioritizing content on the page that I'm already on?\nOkay, fine. Rust docs don't do that either. Lets search for List.Add then:\n\n...\nsigh\nYes, you are required to include the &lt;T&gt; when searching for the method. The most baffling part is that they've put in the effort to allow anything in place of the generic\n\nBut you can't add a space between multiple generic parameters\n\nAnd yet nobody considered that an issue, or even thought \"hey, maybe we should also match on things that don't have the generic too, for convenience reasons\".\nAnd don't worry, I'm still not done with C#. Inspecting the struct is a nightmare. Why isn't there a separate section for static and const members? Why are they lumped in with fields? What if someone forgets to mention that something is const and now people are trying to modify it and getting confused?\n\nThese short-form descriptions are usually just restating the name of the function, thus are pointless. Also, there really wasn't a better way for you to represent overloaded functions besides making them look like an entirely unique function entry?\n\nClicking on either of those functions even sends you to the same page that has all the overloads on it. Were these pages made by different people who didn't communicate with each other or look at the final product at all?\nOh yeah, one other thing about those function signatures. Did you notice that they don't include the return type? There isn't even a distinction between methods that return &lt;a value&gt; and methods that return nothing at all. I don't understand how this happens. Did they forget? Is something broken and nobody noticed? Why do I have to click to a new webpage and view the code snippet of the function declaration to even know what the return type is?\nAnyway, even once you get to the method pages, the documentation is wildly inconsistent. Some of it is fantastic and detailed, some of it leaves you scratching your head. The official description of their own API is titled \"Remarks\". While that is hilarious, it kinda gives away how much effort they felt like putting in.\nI could go on about C# for hours, but I'll leave you with one final thing:\n\nYou uh... maybe want to put that in like a table or bulleted list or grid or something? Maybe ignore the generic when sorting it? Last I checked I'm not a CSV parser. Also why is there a space before each comma?\nJava#\n\nJava's docs are surprisingly hard to find as someone who has never written any Java. Maybe I'm just dumb but searching \"java api docs\" puts Java 8 at the top of the list, followed by Java SE 7, and SE 19. For reference, the current up-to-date version of java is uh... let me consult the release matrix...\n\nI burst out laughing when I saw this. It's like it was intentionally designed to be as confusing as possible. I can't decide which terrible feature is my favorite.\n\nDates on both axes\nThe table doesn't size itself to the window, but the blue top-banner does so there's just sad whitespace on the top if you scroll to the right\n\"My favorite month is JDK 21 (bold)\"\nColumn named \"Month\", contains more than just the month. If only there was a word for a month and a year. Maybe I'll think of it at a later date.\nVertical dividers? Nah, that's what padding is for. Wait there's no padding either?\n\"Last 5 years\", whose first sub-header is \"Planned\" (contains 2 future years)\n\nAlso links to an entirely separate page with an even larger, uglier table\n\n\nList view \"button\" that takes you to a page that's somehow just as bad\n\nContains a \"View by Month\" \"button\" that takes you back to the matrix page. Why isn't it called \"Table View\" or \"Matrix View\"?\nWhat does \"CPU\" mean in this context? What does \"Feature 23\" mean?\nRelease types/support timeline/naming scheme at the bottom, beneath this massive list, but you don't have a table of contents so nobody's ever going to know it exists and there are no header links so if you want to show someone you have to say \"yeah just keep scrolling for about 15 years it's definitely down there\"\n\n\n\nBut anyway, I was able to locate a hub page with links to documents for Java SE/ME/EE. Except clicking the \"documentation\" links for SE, ME, and EE do not take you to the API docs. Each variant has a \"landing page\", each with completely different layouts from for some reason, and clicking on a link there will bring you to the API documentation. Jesus.\nAnyway, once we finally get to the current docs (Java 22 I think?), it's borderline unreadable at full-width because the text is miniscule and isn't width-bounded. Great.\n\nHey wait, if Java SE doesn't necessarily implement all of the JDK, why doesn't the JDK have its own documentation page for just the JDK? Sorta like how Rust separates core from std.\nIt does resize properly, and demonstrates that if they'd just width-bound the page it wouldn't be quite so hard to read.\n\nAlso, when you skimmed the page did you notice that the text \"file system provider\" is a link? I sure didn't. Maybe it's just my monitor, but that blue-ish color with that teeny-tiny font on that bright background isn't quite distinct enough from... wait their default font color isn't even black? It's #474747. That's like a medium grey. Can we stop doing that? What is wrong with black text?\nIn any case, the links turn orange on hover, but who cares. This is not a 90's adventure game, I'm not pixel hunting for your links.\nSyntax highlighting? Never heard of it.\n\nWhy are these nav-bar buttons sometimes not buttons? Shouldn't they just not be there if they aren't applicable, or maybe greyed out or something? Clicking on Class treats it as text, but Use is clearly a button\n\n\nBut hey, at least their search feature isn't insulting.\nC/C++#\n\nMaybe it's not fair to pick on cppreference since it's not \"official\" docs, but it's where everyone tells you to go, so oh well. Right off the bat it's pretty bad. I was not surprised in the slightest to scroll to the bottom of the page and see a MediaWiki logo.\n\nCouple of first impressions:\n\nOw my eyes\nLet me get out my microscope for this text (Those sub-headings are 9px high. Nine. What the fuck.)\nIs the line-height set to a negative value? Why is everything so smooshed together?\nNo side-bar navigation at all\nThings are organized, but sorted in what looks like a pretty arbitrary way\nIs everything so small because you're trying to cram all of the C++ stuff within one screen-view and not show any C stuff? Why is it hanging out all the way down there like an 11th toe?\n\nAt first I thought it couldn't handle half-width properly, since it always had a horizontal scroll bar with some dead space. Turns out that's not the case. I've been writing this on my laptop, which uses the 125% scaling option through Windows because otherwise my taskbar icons are sized for amoebas. The site works fine on half-width at 100% scaling, but not at 125%. I didn't know this was something that could even be a problem.\n\nAt 100% scaling though, there is one small problem. Did you spot it?\n\nAs if the search bar wasn't cursed enough.\nI wish I could move on and talk about the actual content of the pages, but unfortunately there's one more piece of mangled text we should look at. I'd isolate it, but that would make it look better than it is, so here's the whole page.\n\nGood god. How did this even happen? Was that text put through a crusher, flipped on its side, and put through another, slightly stronger crusher? Why does it look like a jpeg instead of actual text? Seriously, go to the website and check it out yourself, it's wild. Using the browser zoom doesn't fix this issue, the text just like... has the wrong aspect ratio and resolution somehow? I don't even know.\nIn any case, the examples are kinda syntax highlighted, there's a decent amount of internal linking, so that's nice. It's not the fault of the documentation, but having to follow every definition with a bulleted list of \"here's how to use this without instantly breaking everything\" is pretty funny. The descriptions are generally pretty good, but I found the examples to be exceedingly lacking when I was first learning C.\nThe real issue is the layout. Everything is so smooshed together. It's especially bad with tables and headers, which seemingly aren't allowed any padding at all. It leads to weak skim-ability and the lack of a nav-bar hurts it even more. The best way to navigate the page ends up being ctrl+F. There aren't even header-links which is a shame.\n\nIt's especially horrible when there's lots of functions (or overloaded functions) within a page. I'm honestly not sure if this is a spacing issue, a font issue, a code-formatting issue, a highlighting issue, or something else but it takes genuine effort and willpower to stop my eyes from giving up halfway through a function signature when it's buried in this nonsense.\n\nGo#\n\n\nGo is a mixed bag. The layout is okay, it's got a light and dark mode, decently readable text coloring (though the light grey could be made a bit darker in the light theme). It resizes properly - though I'd prefer if the full-width view was width-bounded and had less space between the name of the sub-module and its description. It has (kinda functional) search, and everything is well organized on each page.\nMy main issue with Go comes from dogfooding their own documentation system. While I appreciate that confidence, I do think the standard library is a little bit special and deserves to be segregated from things made by &lt;not google&gt;. There's also quite a bit of metadata at the top of the page that's pointless for the language standard library.\n\nOnce again we have slight search issues. The dogfooding means searches will have things from the entire Go package database even if you only care about things in the standard library. It could be partially fixed by prioritizing results from the page you're already on, but really it should just have its own separate subdomain on the Go website.\n\nThe bigger problem is that Go has pulled the Python mistake and ruined their SEO by putting all their built-in types on a single page. It took a minute to realize that Map is a built-in type, thus is not documented with the rest of the standard library. Rust does not have this issue since their docs are slightly unique compared to the docs everyone else gets. In particular, none of the types are considered \"special\" in Rust. All of the built-in's are documented identically to those in the standard library, and are accessed from the same page. Not only is it easier to find manually, it also ensures consistency and improves search performance (both internal and through a search engine). This might not be so bad if the standard library documentation linked to the place where Map is specified, but it just sorta doesn't.\n\nOh yeah, and that isn't syntax highlighting, those types are just blue because they're links. The expand-o examples are even worse. Just dozens of lines of white-on-grey text. There aren't even line numbers. While it's cool that you can modify them, format them, and run them in the browser, I'm not sure who would want to when it looks like that.\nAnyway, the documentation for the map type is not contained anywhere on the first or second page of google search. I won't bother looking further because most people won't have made it that far.\n\nBy manually navigating the Go home page, I was able to find the language specification that describes the built-in types.\n\nI take back what I said about the layout being okay. No sidebar, no search (aside from control F), a giant mostly unformatted list of the headers that simultaneously extends offscreen and leaves a bunch of empty space. Yuck.\nOverall though, I really don't have a ton to complain about. Go follows the trend of many modern languages in having documentation that's simple and solid, but also has a few major flaws (e.g. Zig, Odin).\nJavascript#\n\nJavascript joins the C/C++ gang in not having an official documentation meant to be read by human beings. Neat. That leaves me to talk about MDN. It's worth noting here that I'm browsing all of these via an incognito window, so none of my extensions are enabled. I'm sorta surprised it took this long for this to come up but uh...\n\nKinda terrible first impression. I know Mozilla has to make money somehow but ads on the language docs? Oof. There's another banner if you scroll all the way down as well.\nThe best way to describe MDN is \"wasted space\". Three separate bars on the top is a bit much, though the top advertisement does go away on scroll thankfully. Where Rust and Python's docs felt tastefully width-bounded, MDN feels cramped and busy. The large font (16px vs Rust and Python's 14px) and narrow main article make the line length extremely short. Text ends up hard to parse, and it becomes easy to get \"distracted\" by the surrounding elements. Centering rather than left-aligning compounds this issue, and the half-width view makes it clear how much better things are by just removing the left-side whitespace. It does pose another small issue though.\n\nsigh Of course you'd block half your side-bar with an ad.\nIt's been a problem in other docs, but I want to point it out here since it's such a clear-cut case. Why is the search function hidden in the burger menu? You have 700 pixels of width in the top bar doing absolutely nothing. I search things a lot in the docs. Just put the search bar next to the burger menu.\nPast that though, MDN is fine. The docs link frequently, have decent examples (including clearly labeled passing and failing examples, which is great!)\n\nCode is syntax highlighted, the search and side-bar filter both work decently well.\nIt's just a website#\n\nReally this is the key to me - both why I can't believe it's still the way it is, and why I bothered to say anything in the first place. HTML and CSS are easy to change. It does not take a new language to have new docs, and it doesn't even take a major new language version to spruce up your existing ones. If I'm gonna spend a third of my life staring at these stupid pages, it would help a lot if they were designed to be read and navigated instead of whatever we've got going on right now.\n","id":"https://walnut356.github.io/posts/language-documentation/","title":"Why is language documentation still so terrible?"},"https://walnut356.github.io/posts/lldbs-typesystems-an-unfinished-interface/":{"body":"Well, it's \"done\". TypeSystemRust has a (semi) working prototype for LLDB 19.x. It doesn't support expressions or MSVC targets (i.e. PDB debug info), and there are a whole host of catastrophic crashes, but it more or less proves what it needs to: Rust's debugging experience can be improved, and there are worthwhile benefits to a working TypeSystem that can't be emulated on other layers of the debugging stack.\nIf you want to test it out, you'll need to build my fork from source (sorry), but then lldb.exe can be used as-is, or you can point a debugger extension like lldb-dap or CodeLLDB to your newly built lldb-dap.exe or liblldb.dll respectively. If you're on Windows, make sure to compile for MSVC otherwise CodeLLDB won't be able to interface with liblldb properly.\n\nThis is a loose followup to my previous post about improving Rust's debugging experience. It's not 100% necessary reading, but explains some details about the debugging stack, the challenges of getting debug output to work properly with different debuggers, and why I'd spend a such a big chunk of time on this. For reference, this plugin took me a little over a month to write. I didn't track hours because I'm a dummy, but I'd probably put it in the ballpark of 80-100. I'd like to think that's due to the mitigating factors that I'll get into below, rather than me just being slow. It also would have taken significantly longer had I not had Vadimcn's LLDB 16.x TypeSystemRust to use as a reference (if you're reading this, your warnings were 100% correct lol).\nTo quickly list some benefits of a dedicated TypeSystem:\n\nDrastically improved performance, especially when displaying container types (e.g. Vec, Hashmap, etc.) due to SyntheticProviders being compiled C++ rather than python scripts. There's also ways to cut down on a decent amount of the regex usage.\nDebug nodes can be interpreted in arbitrary ways, meaning we can convey significantly more information to the debugger at compile-time. This means we have a ton more options to prettify the output and extract useful information (e.g. mut vs non-mut pointers/refs/variables, better/easier dyn T inspection, better source-mapping of closures)\nRust expressions in the lldb repl (e.g. x as *const u8 rather than (u8*)x, x.y instead of x-&gt;y) and could allow for some very cool tricks like retrieving Hashmap values through the familiar map[key] syntax.\nDebugger visualizer scripts should end up easier for library authors to write since we can ensure consistent information regardless of the debug info available - currently PDB-based debug info requires a few helping hands from the script to do its job properly. By stuffing those hacks in the TypeSystem, we wouldn't need to have a string-manipulation-get_template_args function in every single python script. We could also improve the SBType and SBValue interfaces themselves to allow them to access more of the DWARF modifiers and possibly upstream those improvements to LLDB itself.\n\nIf the title of the post wasn't clear, I have some... opinions regarding my experience writing the plugin. I do intend to help contribute to some fixes, but I'm one person with limited time and motivation. I want to record my thoughts here though, because I think they're the most valuable at this exact moment: I'm now somewhat familiar with LLDB internals, but 2 months ago I was starting from 0. It's easy for people creating &lt;a thing&gt; to lose perspective and not understand the difficulties faced by those who don't already have an intimate understanding of the system itself or its context (supporting systems, jargon, domain knowledge). That perspective is vitally important for a public API that is meant to be used by people who aren't LLDB devs.\nOn one hand, it's a very powerful interface and it surprised me with how much \"just works\" by implementing relatively few functions. On the other, the architecture is unbelievably convoluted and the documentation is, with no exaggeration, completely non-existent. I think it is incredibly close to being in a mainstream-useable state, but the current issues make it difficult to recommend to the third party languages it's trying to appeal to.\nAs of writing, I know of exactly 3 implementations of the TypeSystem interface aside from mine: TypeSystemClang, which is shipped with LLDB and supports C/C++ (with partial support for Pascal, Rust, and D); TypeSystemSwift which is maintained by literally Apple in their fork of LLVM; and TypeSystemRust, formerly upkept by Vadimcn for the popular CodeLLDB VSCode extension.\nAfter writing my own TypeSystemRust, the low number of implementers does not surprise me.\nWhat does a TypeSystem do?#\n\nI mentioned this in my previous post, but the official docs don't really say. Alarmingly, the comments in the source code don't explain anything either:\n\nThe first two lines basically say \"A TypeSystem is a TypeSystem\". I've said it before, but ideal documentation should, bare minimum, answer the following 3 questions:\n\nWhat does this do?\nWhy would I want it to (use-case, comparison to similar methods, etc.)?\nHow does it do it (internal implementation, performance characteristics, failure states)?\n\nThe third question is answered, but the first two aren't. Perusing the methods is equally unhelpful; the majority have no comments at all and their names require a bunch of contextual knowledge to understand. Some appear similar in name to parts of the Python interface, but that's still not an answer. TypeSystemClang's comments (of which there are few) and implementation also don't make things any clearer, but for different reasons that I'll get into later.\nA quick once-over of the Language and LanguageRuntime interfaces suggests that those plugins are used similarly to the Python interface - run-time value inspection and formatting. It's not clear how TypeSystem fits into that. The only other hint given by the official docs is that if the debug info is coming from DWARF, the TypeSystem should subclass DWARFASTParser.\nDWARF AST Parsing, Types, and Decls#\n\nDWARFASTParser is an interface that takes raw dwarf debug info entries (DIE's or, informally, nodes) from a SymbolFileDWARF and turns them into an in-memory representation of the type (which I'll call LangType). A void* to the LangType is then wrapped in a CompilerType, which associates it with the appropriate TypeSystem. The CompilerType is passed back to the SymbolFileDWARF, which associates it with its DIE for later retrieval, wraps it in an lldb::Type - an object that also contains contextual information about the type - and passes a shared pointer to that back to the DWARFASTParser. The DWARFASTParser populates the contextual information if possible, and then passes the lldb::Type back to whoever called ParseTypeFromDWARF in the first place.\nUh.... huh.\nIn Rust terms, the class layout it looks vaguely like this:\n\nThe purpose of this \"telescopic\" class layout is, ostensibly, to allow arbitrary LangType structs and TypeSystem implementations.\nIn context, that implies that the purpose of the TypeSystem is to cast the void* back to a LangType* and interpret the internals of that LangType for queries like GetByteSize() and GetFieldAtIndex(), right?\n\nWell... maybe.\nI'm going to come back to that, but first I want to cover the architectural issues. The whole Type, CompilerType, LangType thing isn't horrible, but mixed with the litany of other classes that work this way it gets very tangled very quickly.\nThere's this feeling of inconsistency when operating on data, because it's not always clear when you should be storing/using any of the 3 layers of Type objects (which doesn't even count things like TypeImpl and SBType). To make matters worse, the names of classes and methods aren't descriptive enough on their own to convey intent properly. You can dig into the implementation, but that's a huge undertaking because the class relationships make it hard to find where the logic-code even is.\nDWARFDIE is a big offender. 90% of your time implementing the DWARFASTParser is monkeying with DWARFDIE objects and their subsidiaries (DWARFAttributes, DWARFFormValue, etc.). Does the DIE in DWARFDIE stand for Debug Info Entry? Probably, but if so, why is there also a DWARFDebugInfoEntry class and in what way is it different? Neither are documented in any way, so you'll have to figure that out for yourself. I had a good laugh the first time I saw GetDIE(), a DWARFDIE method which returns a DWARFDebugInfoEntry. That method doesn't have a doc comment either so it just looks like absolute nonsense.\nLet's say you have a DWARFFormValue - a wrapper around the data in a DWARF attribute - and you call Reference() on it. One overload returns a DWARFDIE, other other takes a uint64_t and returns a uint64_t. What does that function do? How can the overloads possibly accomplish the same thing with return-type differences like that? Some DWARF attributes like DW_AT_type store offsets into the DWARF file that point to other DWARF nodes. I assume the first overload \"dereferences\" that offset and returns the appropriate DIE. But not every attribute tag stores an offset. Can this function fail? How so? If it really does what I think it does, why isn't it called Dereference, or GetReferencedDIE? The latter is the name of a method on DWARFDIE (that, funnily enough, ends up calling DWARFFormValue::Reference()) and is a much better \"self documenting\" name than Reference.\nCan I find this out by reading the source code? Kinda, but I end up having to jump down 7 other rabbit holes. Should I be able to hover over the type name and have most those questions answered in a few seconds by the doc comments? Yes.\nSeveral dozen hours into writing the TypeSystem, I read in the LLVM contribution guidelines that every class and function needs to be described. It specifically states \"The reader should be able to understand how to use interfaces without reading the code itself\". Would that I could describe the bitter, betrayed sound that escaped my throat in that moment. The handful of words that followed are left to your imagination.\nI'm going to temporarily put on the green goblin mask to prove a point, so don't worry too much if you don't understand the finer details.\nA Quick Jaunt into Madness#\n\nNear the end of the DWARFASTParser implementation, I had to write functions to create and retrieve Decl and DeclContext objects. In short, Decls are declarations/definitions of structs, typedefs, functions, etc. DeclContexts are scopes (compile unit, struct, lexical block, etc.) and they store Decls. Worth noting, both of these classes are defined within libclang, not liblldb. They also have the same CompilerDecl relationship to Decl as CompilerType has to LangType. None of that is clear at first glance and requires digging into a bunch of other stuff, but if I went into that we'd be here all day.\n\nTo figure out where DeclContexts come from and how they're associated with type in the first place, I started with the TypeSystemClang entry point GetDeclContextForType, which is passed a CompilerType&amp;. GetDeclContextForType internally calls an overloaded version of the same function that takes a QualType. That QualType is acquired via ClangUtil::GetQualType(compiler_type) Now we have additional questions: what is ClangUtil::GetQualType, and what is a QualType?\nQualType diversion#\n\nInternally, that calls QualType::getFromOpaquePtr(compiler_type.GetOpaqueQualType()) which is pretty straight forward. Except 1. getFromOpaquePtr uses a different capitalization scheme from seemingly the entire rest of the LLVM codebase for some reason? and 2. GetOpaqueQualType just returns the void* to the LangType.\nBut wait, since the CompilerType function is specifically called \"get opaque QualType\", that means QualType - defined within the clang compiler itself - is the expected type underlying CompilerType's void*, right? Does that mean I should be using QualType for TypeSystemRust? Surely not, otherwise why use a void* at all?\nAnyway, QualType is a packed-pointer type, basically a clang::Type* with a bit of extra metadata. Looking at the methods of QualType, it looks like it's very much built for C/C++ types. clang::Type (different from lldb::Type) appears to be a bitfields describing a type.\nAnyway, where were we again?\nBack to DeclContexts#\n\nRight, TypeSystemClang::GetDeclContextForType, which takes a QualType. For a quick tracer bullet, we'll look only at how struct types are handled. That code path returns llvm::cast&lt;clang::RecordType&gt;(qual_type)-&gt;getDecl(). Alright, so what is a RecordType?\nRecordType diversion#\n\nRecordType is a child of TagType that seems to be used purely for classification purposes, like a sum-type enum in Rust. So what is TagType?\nTagType diversion#\n\nA child of clang::Type, but with 1 extra member of type TagDecl. What is a TagDecl?\nTagDecl divsersion#\n\nAccording to the doc comment, \"Represents the declaration of a struct/union/class/enum.\" and it inherits from DeclContext among other things.\nBack to RecordType#\n\nWhere were we? Oh yeah, RecordType::getDecl(). That returns (RecordDecl*)(TagType::getDecl()). What does TagType::getDecl() do?\nBack to TagType#\n\nReturns getInterestingTagDecl(decl). Yes, it's really called that. So what does getInterestingTagDecl do?\nInteresting TagDecl diversion#\n\nIt iterates over \"redecls\" and returns the first one that passes isCompleteDefinition() || isBeingDefined().\nSo what is a redecl?\nRedecl diversion#\n\nclangd points me to an inherited function from Redeclarable&lt;TagDecl&gt;, whose doc comment helpfully explains \"Returns an iterator range for all the redeclarations of the same decl. It will iterate at least once (when this decl is the only one)\". Neat I guess? So we can more or less pretend that it doesn't exist. But wait, how does TagDecl fit into this again? We saw it earlier, but now we need to know more.\nBack to TagDecl#\n\nTagDecl inherits Decl and DeclContext. The DeclContext bitfields are what are inspected via isCompleteDefinition() and isBeingDefined().\nThat value is then reinterpret_cast into a RecordDecl*, which has a bit of extra struct-related data.\nSo all-in-all, we have something like this? I don't even know\n\nAll of that, only to learn that a DeclContext should already be associated with a type before GetDeclContextForType is called and that it's function is just a simple member retrieval. Great...\nWhile we're here, I just want to once again draw your attention to how many diversions you haven't seen. I presented you with a definition of DeclContext at the start of this and hand-waved away how I figured that out. The DeclContext class, being in clang instead of lldb, has a doc comment. It begins with the following:\n\nand then proceeds to list thirteen other classes. And you're telling me that's not all of them?\nGood god.\nSo no, I wasn't exaggerating when I said we'd be here all day if I didn't gloss over things. The kicker? The minimum information necessary to store in a DeclContext is the scope's name and a list of child Decls. Clang's DeclContext declaration (not definition) spans 1329 lines of C++ code. DeclContextRust's - which is both declaration and definition - takes just 44.\nHopefully I've made my point. Was any part of that explanation confusing? Did your eyes glaze over? Does some of the complexity seem a bit unnecessary?\nEverything is like this. It's maddening. I called it a possible skill issue before, but I don't think so now. It really is just 17 layers of indirection when 0 would do. I mentioned before that TypeSystemClang wasn't a useful resource to explain what a TypeSystem does and this is why. It's a gigantic time-sink to understand, and once you finally do, you realize it ties itself to the clang compiler in a way that other languages can't, with underlying representations that contain huge swaths information that the debugger API can't even take advantage of.\nI'll say again, it was still this painful after several dozen hours of mucking around in adjacent parts of LLDB and clang.\nI get that piggybacking on clang's classes saves time, but the utility and specificity required by the compiler vs the debugger are so different that I feel like it's just not worth it. TypeSystemClang doesn't exist purely as a reference for people to use when implementing their own TypeSystem, but does have to serve as one. Muddying that reference this much for a small-ish time save and dubious extra functionality feels like a mistake to me.\nWhat does TypeSystem do? (for real this time)#\n\nMost TypeSystem functions take a void*, cast it to a LangType*, and then operate on the underlying data to answer queries like GetByteSize, IsEnumerationType, and GetFieldAtIndex\nIn my case, the implementation of TypeSystemRust::GetByteSize (or any inspection function for that matter) does not require any data that doesn't already exist within the RustType struct I've defined. Which makes sense, because RustType is how you communicate the debug info to the rest of LLDB in the first place.\nSo what does the TypeSystem itself do?\nNothing.\nOr, at least, nothing that can't be done by something else. My implementation has precisely 1 capability that isn't handled somewhere else - a map that associates DWARFDIEs with their respective CompilerDecl/CompilerDeclContext. And even that should be handled by the SymbolFileDWARF, which already has a map that associates DWARFDIEs with CompilerTypes.\nI'm sure I could technically think of a use for being able to store info that can be accessed for all the types collectively, but I struggle to see the point when the ASTParser and SymbolFile interfaces can already do that. I do not understand why a LangType can't just inspect itself via a Type interface, with both the TypeSystem and CompilerType classes thrown in the garbage. It seems like all we're doing with a TypeSystem is manually implementing a v-table. Maybe there's a good reason for this, I don't know. Without any explanation, it feels unnecessary.\nMixed Messages#\n\nI want to make it clear that, in the official docs, it is offhandedly mentioned that \"If your type info is going to come from DWARF info, you will want to subclass DWARFASTParser.\"\nAbout 80% of the time I've spent so far was researching and implementing the DWARFASTParser and the RustType objects. I spent a single day writing the TypeSystem itself, and the remaining few days were spent writing the Language plugin that does things like displaying Vec elements instead of its heap pointer. Another sizeable chunk of time still needs to go into writing an expression parser.\nIf your goal is to get a better output than TypeSystemClang and it can't be fixed with the public SB API, the improvement is going to come from interpreting the debug info differently via ASTParser - thus generating different LangType objects - or via the Language plugin, which can interact with the LangType internals. If your goal is non-C expressions for the repl, that comes from the ExpressionParser, not the TypeSystem.\nTypeSystem is the vast minority of the work and does not really accomplish anything in isolation. It's just a middleman. The docs definitely do not make it clear enough that that is the case. Realizing \"oh, this is actually going to be 10x more work than I was lead to believe\" is not fun.\nI guess maybe you could write a TypeSystem that uses QualType, thus you don't have to write your own DWARFASTParser but like... the point of this is third party language support. As a reminder, QualType relies on clang::Type, the internal representation for types in a C/C++ compiler. It is incredibly C-oriented, rightfully so. But that makes it very unsuited to third party languages when they have non-C concepts, or disagree with C about what a term \"means\". In Rust a reference is a borrowing pointer. In C++, a reference is a magical \"maybe a pointer, maybe not, but you interact with it like it's not, wOoOoO\" that debuggers treat as such.\n\nFrom cppreference:\nReferences are not objects; they do not necessarily occupy storage, although the compiler may allocate storage if it is necessary to implement the desired semantics (e.g. a non-static data member of reference type usually increases the size of the class by the amount necessary to store a memory address).\nBecause references are not objects, there are no arrays of references, no pointers to references, and no references to references\n\nThis causes dumb issues that conflict with Rust's semantics even if the debug info is 100% accurate from the Rust compiler.\nIt might be a different story if there was a TypeSystemLLVM and a default DWARFASTParserLLVM that more or less just exposed the raw DWARF data in a default \"sane\" way. Maybe by assuming the data was generated via LLVM's DIBuilder API, and that if you have the DW_TAG_struct node, it probably represents a struct. At that point, it's on the compiler devs to make sure they're generating sane debug info, which is easy because they already are. There wouldn't be anything to gain or lose by implementing your own DWARF parser - a huge time-save for implementers - and the LLVMType objects given out could then be interpreted uniquely by the TypeSystem and/or Language plugin. Maybe that was the goal at some point, but right now we're in this awkward interim where the pieces don't fit together quite right.\nOh yeah, I almost forgot. What if your debug info comes from PDB, as it does for Rust compiled to *-msvc? Well, you get to eat shit.\nDWARFASTParser is an interface and is not TypeSystem-aware, so it can be subclassed by your TypeSystem, or you can make a standalone DWARFASTParserRust. For some reason, PDBASTParser is not an interface.  Not only does PDBASTParser's constructor require a TypeSystem it explicitly requires a TypeSystemClang.\n\nThe can-of-worms required to fix that is why my prototype doesn't have PDB support at the moment.\nWill it make Rust debugging better?#\n\nWe've now arrived back at the title of the post. The TypeSystem/language support interface feels 80% complete. It's so close to being a game changer for debugging, but it's not something I could reasonably ask people on the Rust team (let alone random OSS contributors) to learn about and help maintain.\nMaybe the convoluted architecture wouldn't be so bad if there were proper explanations of what everything is, what it does, and why it exists. Maybe the lack of documentation wouldn't be so bad if the architecture was simple and straightforward. As it stands though, both combined makes it too difficult to onboard people.\nTo be clear, I don't actually think the total surface area of ASTParser + TypeSystem + Language + ExpressionParser is too much, it's just too difficult to figure out how to implement them. I can see, beneath the current issues, a version of this interface that's reasonable to implement by a single person in a few days for their toy language, with no loss in power or flexibility.\nIt also might not be quite as easy to distribute as it appeared on the tin. It's called a \"plugin\", and LLDB has the capability to load some plugins dynamically at runtime. But from what I can tell, TypeSystem requires a full standalone build of LLDB because it works through LLDB's private internals rather than the SB API. I could absolutely be wrong about this, I haven't experimented with it enough to have a confident answer. If I'm right though, it'd be pretty disappointing. Building and distributing custom LLDB is a much bigger ask than distributing a TypeSystemRust.dll.\nSo as it stands, Rust debugging probably won't improve beyond little tweaks or fixes in the short term. That may change if the situation with LLDB improves, or if the core Rust maintainers take a keen interest and push through the roadblocks, akin to Apple with TypeSystemSwift.\nIn any case, I'll keep plugging away at this prototype, and maybe make some contributions to LLDB itself. Maybe some day it'll be more than a prototype. All of the groundwork is there for a better debugging experience, it's just going to take some time and some elbow grease.\n\nLast but not least, I have a few specific nitpicks. I hate to have them hanging off the end like this, but this post was already such a nightmare to organize and pace, so it is what it is.\n\n\nThere are no facilities that I could find to inspect a TypeSystem at run-time. I couldn't see which TypeSystems were loaded, dump their states, nor determine which languages were associated with which TypeSystem.\n\n\nIf multiple TypeSystems are valid for a single language, there's no way to pick which one to use aside from removing the language from the results of TypeSystem::SupportsLanguage and recompiling. That means if there ever is an official TypeSystemRust (or TypeSystem can be loaded as a plugin), there would have to be an upstream change to TypeSystemClang to remove the Rust language flag.\n\n\nThere's weird little problems with the public SB interfaces. Some DWARF tags (including ones that C/C++ uses, such as the DW_AT_mutable or the restrict modifier) may as well not exist because there's no way to actually look at them via the SBType interface. It's weird because lldb::Type even has functions to add/remove the restrict modifier from a type, but the user-facing SBType interface can't access it so what's the point?\n\n\nThe function that allows you override a type's name when printing it out (python: get_type_name, C++ GetSyntheticTypeName) is not publicly documented despite being a massive feature of the SyntheticProvider. It's not mentioned anywhere, despite the documentation describing the \"full\" interface.\n\n\nHeaders relying on headers that are generated at compile time (like SBLanguages.h) is a weird choice. I'm sure there's a reason for it, but it leads to a lot of little annoyances prior to the first full build if you aren't able to source those files from elsewhere. This is partially on me for building this on Windows because I hate myself, but I don't think the requirement of a special lldb-dev package on Linux is a great situation either.\n\n\nLLDB is dependent on clang, which means you need to do an in-tree build of clang before you can do a standalone build of LLDB. Everything is there, I'm not sure why cmake can't make it work without having to sit through 30+ minutes of a full clang compile, but it's pretty annoying.\n\n\nAn option to build liblldb as a static lib would be awesome for those of us who want to make FFI wrappers. Last I checked there was a PR for it, but when I tried to build from that PR I ended up with a bunch of linker errors that I wasn't able to diagnose - but I'm also not experienced with that stuff, so it could be a simple fix or a Windows issue. If that's not an option, a C interface akin to LLVM-C would be a huge help instead.\n\n\nthe formatter byte code, while cool, is borderline worthless for targets that don't end up populating template args (e.g. TypeSystemClang with PDB debug info). You most want synthetic providers for container types, but if you can't get the type of the element, you can't cast the container's pointer. Being able to look up an arbitrary type by name could help, or TypeSystemClang could just actually pull the template args from PDB info. I know PDB doesn't have them explicitly, but TypeSystemClang primarily handles C++ and Rust, both of which use the same S&lt;T&gt; syntax for templates.\n\n\nFrom what I can tell, the only way to apply a Synthetic to a type is via a regex, an exact name match, or a callback via a python script. There should definitely be a way to take a C++ callback of some kind. For example, there's nothing in a Rust type's name that distinguishes a struct from a sum-type enum. Checking via regex requires a raw .* wildcard (which the current Rust-distributed scripts currently do), and then delegating to a \"default\" and \"enum\" provider, which is exorbitantly wasteful. Using a python function isn't much better since, well, it's python.\n\n\nIn the C++ code you can return an invalid synthetic provider, but it still flags the type as having a synthetic, which causes issues for downstream consumers. For example, CodeLLDB adds an extra dropdown menu for values with synthetic types. Populating those isn't cheap when you have a Vec with 2000 u8's in it.\nConversely, it's trivial for the Language plugin to cast the opaque type pointer to a RustType and call IsSumType(). It would be awesome if I could attach synthetics via that function. There is a disgusting hack that hijacks an unrelated function to accomplish that, but that really shouldn't be necessary\n","id":"https://walnut356.github.io/posts/lldbs-typesystems-an-unfinished-interface/","title":"LLDB's TypeSystems: An Unfinished Interface"},"https://walnut356.github.io/posts/lldbs-typesystems-pt-2/":{"body":"In my previous post, I described implementing PDB parsing as a can of worms. That might have been a bit of an understatement. PDB has been one \"oh, it's gonna be twice as much work as I thought\" after another. Implementing it has revealed many of the same issues as the TypeSystem itself: lack of documentation, cryptic implementations, poor naming schemes, and unclear expectations. Despite all that, I was able to get it working.\nThat means TypeSystemRust can be used for executables that target *-gnu or *-msvc. It's not quite done yet, but this is a massive step towards the TypeSystem being fully complete. I want to talk a bit about the process, at least partially for posterity. As we'll see later, PDB itself is also not documented very well, so any additional literature could be helpful to someone down the line.\nFair warning, we're getting into the weeds. This is gonna be a long one.\n\nBefore I get more into that though, I want to give a few updates to the situation surrounding the debugging experience, as several people have contacted me after my previous posts. If you want to get straight into the PDB part of this post, click here. The TL;DR is this: both Rust compiler maintainers and LLDB maintainers are interested in improving Rust's debugging experience.\nLLVM and TypeSystemRust#\n\nIn my blanket post about Rust's debug info, before I started implementing a TypeSystem, I posed the question: if Rust gets a TypeSystem, does it live in the Rust repo or the LLVM repo? While there's still not a solid answer, I have heard second-hand information from an LLDB maintainer: they would be open to Rust's TypeSystem living in LLDB's source, as well as a top-level rust directory in LLVM for any rustc-related dependencies. That directory would facilitate a \"proper\" TypeSystemRust implementation: the true intention is to have it interface directly with the target language's compiler, thus the target language's internal representation of types.\nDirect compiler integration would theoretically allow for more accurate expression parsing, more/better information available from the types, etc. In my previous post, I mentioned that this integration was probably helpful for clang, but that other languages couldn't leverage it. Turns out leveraging it is the intention. Whoops. It's a pretty cool idea though, and could be a big deal for features \"native\" to other languages (e.g. Rust's borrows). For the moment though, the instability of the interfaces and the C++ FFI boundary make it somewhat unappealing. I have heard that some are looking to improve the situation, and there is the potential for something like a TypeSystemLLVM that is less opinionated than TypeSystemClang and could make minor customizations much easier for third-party languages.\n\nAside: While looking through some old LLDB threads, I stumbled upon the \"Open Projects\" section of LLDB's documentation. I'd seen this page before, but only ever skimmed it. Reading it more closely shows that LLDB is aware of the issues I've brought up in my previous post. Of particular note are:  \"Finish the language abstraction and remove all the unnecessary API's...How you would go about adding a new language is unclear and much more trouble than it is worth at present\"\"Documentation and better examples\"\"Make a more accessible plugin architecture for lldb... You can't implement any of the actual lldb Plugins as plugins. That means anybody that wants to add new Object file/Process/Language etc support has to build and distribute their own lldb.\"While that last one is extra disappointing, it's good to see that they've identified the problems and are (hopefully) working on a solution.\n\nPDB Parsing#\n\nAs a very short refresher, PDB is a closed-source debug info format made by Microsoft for C. Languages that compile to the MSVC ABI generate PDB debug info, which requires special handling. Before we get into that special handling, I want to briefly talk about the limitations of PDB compared to DWARF.\nCodeView: Too Weak and Too Strong#\n\nPDB itself is a wrapper around CodeView objects. CodeView is a forty year old debugger built for C. As a result, the types of nodes, the data they can carry, and the ways you can find them are quite limited. The CodeView object format is still being updated (sortof?), but not publicly. That leads to a litany of issues.\nFinding any information about PDB/CodeView is rough. LLVM has some information, this ancient spec has some, Microsoft's pdb parser (archived 2023) has some, and Microsoft's msdia documentation has some. And none of it matches. CodeView is clearly still an evolving format, as the msdia docs list an additional user defind data kind (TaggedUnion, possibly equivalent to the DWARF DW_TAG_variant?) compared to even the equivalent data in their archived parser.\nThat would imply that the msdia docs are the one source of truth and the pdb repo is at least slightly outdated, but that's not true. The pdb repo contains information that the msdia docs don't have, and third-party parsers have successfully used that information.\nThe description of Microsoft's PDB repo says \"Just trying to help the CLANG/LLVM community get onto Windows\". While the sentiment is nice, it's disappointing that this repo is no longer maintained and they also won't just open-source the full, modern CodeView specification. Working through all of these outdated/unreliable sources is really painful.\n\nAside: Here's a fun example of how much of a disaster all these sources can be. Niche-optimized 128-bit enums (e.g. NonZero&lt;u128&gt;) result in a 128-bit discriminant value. When you try to inspect any 128-bit values via LLDB, it straight up pretends they don't exist. While the documentation in the rust compiler claims that this is because the debuggers don't support 128-bit discriminants, if you look in the (20 year old) CodeView specification under section 4. Numeric Leaves, CodeView seems to only support 128 bit floats and complex numbers. So it would seem the problem is the format, not the debugger. But LLVM's documentation lists 128-bit types as valid nodes, and so does Rust's pdb crate. The official msdia docs don't list 128-bit integer types, but they do exist in the Microsoft PDB repo.Is that because msdia doesn't handle it and LLVM uses msdia? Probably, but then why doesn't msdia expose it? It's written and consumed by Microsoft, who are the ones who made a 128 bit value type in the first place. Looking into LLVM's source code, it looks like it has handling for that size of value in the hand-written PDB parser, but it just like... still doesn't work for some reason?What a mess.\n\nThe biggest limiting factor with CodeView is that it does not support C++ template types (or in my case, Rust's generic types, I'll use the terms interchangeably). Due to that limitation, Rust's visualizer scripts have special handling whenever that information is missing, which looks up the generic args via string manipulation. Ew. This trick also doesn't even work in some cases for dumb type-discovery reasons I'll get into much later. Even with a TypeSystemRust, that hack would need to exist somewhere in its implementation. It's vital that we do have the generics though. Types like Vec&lt;f64&gt; have a heap pointer that's just a *mut u8, and we need to know the type of the elements so we can cast the pointer properly. Unfortunately, PhantomData does not help us here. It's zero-sized, meaning the type we're looking for is still just PhantomData's generic, so it's just as inaccessible.\nWhile I was reading the CodeView spec earlier this year, a question popped into my mind: \"then how does C# get away with PDB debug info?\". I tried running a C# PDB file through dumpbin and the Rust pdb crate, but both claimed the file was of an invalid format. An email I recieved after my last post brought this up, and I gave it another look. Turns out C# has two different, incompatible debug formats, both called PDB...Very cool, thanks Microsoft.\nThe one generated by default is referred to as \"portable PDB\", but a project flag can force the non-portable, actual PDB format. Running that through a PDB parser revealed that they just bypass the CodeView format entirely using its sole extensibility feature.\nIf you read the CodeView spec, desperately trying to find some hack to fix the generics problem, you might have stumbled across the OEM Generic Type listing. This node is special: Microsoft assigns third-party compiler vendors a unique ID so they can differentiate their respective data, and the node can be filled with an arbitrary byte array.\nSo uhh... literally any problem that CodeView has can be solved. Technically.\nThis is what I mean though when I say CodeView is both too weak and too strong. On one hand, basic functionality seems to be missing. On the other, you could literally invent your own format from scratch to solve those issues, stuff it in OEM nodes, and write extra handling into any debugger that consumes it. It's extensibility, but in a way that requires a ton of work and coordination that nobody really wants to do.\nFor those curious, I'm pretty sure this is the PDB output for a simple 2-field record class in C#. The id_oem is likely the C# compiler's ID. The type index is CodeView's predefined Special-&gt;No type marker meaning the type doesn't exist in the PDB type data stream. The rgl (an arbitrary byte array), I can only speculate about. My guess is it's something that allows the debugger to make use of the run-time type information that's available in C#. As of writing this post, I haven't found the time to look into that further.\n\nI don't think LLVM or Rust have OEM ID's yet. I don't really know that I'm the guy to get them one, nor do I know who I would contact to get the ball rolling. In all fairness, Microsoft open-sourcing a PDB parser largely happened because an LLVM contributor asked nicely, so maybe I'm overthinking things.\nThe other issue is obviously \"what do we actually put in the OEM node?\". A simple solution might be to set the type_index to the type that has generics and fill the byte array with the existing List node types, which contains a list of the generic arguments. That's not a perfect solution though since there might be some awkwardness between generic types (the T in Vec&lt;T&gt;) and generic values (the 2 in ArrayVec&lt;T, 2&gt;). Rust doesn't output generic value debug info at the moment anyway, so that's a can we can kick down the road for the time being.\nAlternatively, we could ignore the oem node and make hacky use of some other existing nodes that Rust doesn't use. There aren't friend classes or base classes in Rust, so we could use those nodes in the Field List to denote generics. Or we could treat it like sum-type enums and add in artificial static fields of the type of the generic.\nThe longest-shot, but least hacky option is asking Microsoft to add some kind of CodeView node for it (and tell us how to serialize/deserialize it). As I said before, the TaggedUnion type was added recently, and the msdia docs specifically mentions its use in Rust (though we also don't know how to serialize/deserialize that). It doesn't seem completely impossible that they would be willing to add a TemplateParameter node.\nI'm currently only looking at it from Rust's perspective but this problem affects C++ too, so a solution would be beneficial to a huge group of people.\nPDB Parsing and Type System Integration#\n\nThe first step in adding PDB handling to a TypeSystem is implementing the following function:\n\nSymbolFilePDB acquires the appropriate TypeSysytem, then calls this function and uses the retrieved PDB parser to handle type nodes and symbol declarations.\nWith the DWARFASTParser, we just return the TypeSystemRust instance itself, since it subclasses DWARFASTParser. That's not possible with PDBASTParser as it exists right now.\n\nYikes. One would think that our main goal is to decouple PDBASTParser from TypeSystemClang, but as with all PDB-related tasks, it's not quite that simple.\nAfter trying (and failing) to decipher the twisted maze of TypeSystemClang's implementation, I attempted to step through the creation of 1 type node. Except, none of my breakpoints in SymbolFilePDB nor PDBASTParser were hit. Some further fiddling revealed that, because I debug via a -gnu build of LLDB, it actually uses SymbolFileNativePDB instead. Whoops.\n\nAside: both llvm and lldb split PDB handling between \"Native\" and \"DIA\". The former is a hand-written parser, whereas the latter is a wrapper around msdia140.dll. You can force native handling on Windows with the environment variable LLDB_USE_NATIVE_PDB_READER = 1\n\nBut wait, why didn't the PDBASTParser breakpoints hit? There is no NativePDBASTParser, and there's a file in the NativePDB directory literally called PdbAstBuilder.h. Shouldn't the AST Builder build an AST for the AST Parser to parse, thus the difference between native and dia is abstracted away for downstream consumers? Apparently not.\nTypeSystem has 2 functions for retrieving the PDB parser: GetPDBParser and GetNativePDBParser. Lets look at the implementation in TypeSystemClang:\n\nSo PdbAstBuilder is the equivalent of PDBASTParser. A little confusing, but alright.\nThere is a pretty big snag though. From what I can tell, aside from setting an environment variable, there's no way to prefer the native parser over the dia parser. That also means there's no way to fall back to one or the other if one of them is invalid for a language. It's not trivial to implement that preference either because you are only able to check which one the TypeSystem implements once you've inspected the PDB data to know which language's TypeSystem to call. Inspecting that data requires having a SymbolFilePDB or SymbolFileNativePDB, at which point it's too late because you've already chosen one.\nThat means I need to implement both.\nI decided to tackle the native PDB parser first, since I can debug that easier and the API made more sense to me. I'll eventually circle back and implement the dia parser.\nRegardless of which one we choose, we need to disentangle PDB parsing from TypeSystemClang and clang's internals. Lets take a quick look for clang-related keywords in the PDB and NativePDB directories.\n\nOh... Oh no.\nThat's not just a return type here or there.\nThe Plan#\n\nDuring my initial implementation of TypeSystemRust, I tried to keep my changes as minimal as possible. I didn't add a whole lot of new files, and I don't think I modified anything outside of the files I added. I even scoped my preferred clang-format options to the folders where my new files exist.\nThat's not really an option here. Not only do I have to modify existing systems, as you'll see later, there are also some pretty unfortunate API's that require tiny changes to make them vastly more useful for any non-clang TypeSystem.\nSuch a large refactor was a bit worrying for me. I've done smaller refactors on my own projects, but with those I'm in full control. I can change anything I want, any way I want. Here, I need to ensure TypeSystemClang still works, that the API is sane, that everything needed for TypeSystemRust is there, that I'm not falling prey to (or giving others) C++ footguns, and that it adheres to the style used in the rest of LLDB and LLVM.\nI decided early on that there was no amount of poking around the codebase that would tell me what data and helpers TypeSystemRust needed, I'd just need to start implementing it and figure out my requirements from there. It's also not very important to have TypeSystemClang in a working state in the interim, so I just had it return nullptr for both GetPDBParser and GetNativePDBParser to make sure it was never used. As a reminder, there is no way to prefer one TypeSystem over another if both say they're valid for a given language. It's important to make sure you aren't accidentally using the wrong TypeSystem when testing.\nI wanted to mirror DWARFASTParser as much as possible for consistency (even though I prefer some of the capitalization and naming schemes of PdbAstBuilder). That resulted in this virtual class:\n\nThis isn't too dissimilar to PdbAstBuilder's methods so I should be able to just wrap it later on.\nPast that, the way I like to handle these poorly documented exploratory projects is to have &lt;something that compiles and runs&gt; as often as possible. With things like the Starcraft Simulator where I'm more confident in how the fundamental pieces work, I'm more willing to spend time making plans and I don't mind long stretches of time without running the program.\nWith something like this though? There's nothing worse than spending dozens of hours thinking a struct or function or piece of data works a specific way, using it all over, and then finding out it actually does something subtly different. It very quickly turns 1 refactor into 17 refactors. I want to be able to check what something does as soon as I can, make adjustments immediately (or put in a // TODO), and be confident in my understanding of each piece of code at every step along the way.\nI bring this up because it shapes the order in which I solve the problems that crop up, it determines when I decide to put off solving something until later, and it's (hopefully) a reasonable excuse as to why sometimes my solutions don't always uh... make any kind of consideration towards the future.\n\nAside: A great example is that every single allocation in TypeSystemRust leaks. There are no smart pointers and no calls to delete. Right now, it compiles and runs for the several minutes I need to check the behavior of various DWARF/CodeView API's so I don't care. It's an easy problem to solve later, and it gives me time to weigh up the different storage mechanisms I could use.I'm leaning towards a flat std::vector&lt;RustType&gt; inside TypeSystemRust. CompilerType needs a pointer to the RustType, but to avoid invalidation issues I can just static_cast the uint64_t index of the RustType to a void* and cast it back when we need to retrieve the type. It's a bit hacky because the 0th element would have to be a dummy value to allow for null \"pointers\" to work as expected, and it'll assuredly segfault if anyone actually derefs the \" void*\", but it'd be less wasteful than a heap allocation filled with pointers to other heap allocations.\n\nOne other point of note is that I dislike refactoring in C++ in general because it's really bad at helping me have &lt;something that compiles and runs&gt; as often as I'd like.\n\nForgetting to implement a function in an interface results in a linker error saying the v-table is the wrong size or whatever, but doesn't actually tell you which function is missing its implementation.\nAutomated refactoring tools like name-change fail every time, even for local variables in a single function (vscode issue?).\nHaving to change function signatures in implementation and header files whenever I realize I need some extra data is surprisingly obnoxious.\nA lack of LSP errors does not mean that it will compile. llvm::DenseMap (equivalent to Rust's built-in HashMap, used because C++ std::unordered_map is 80 bytes and allocates constantly for some fuckin' reason) caused a lot of issues here. Every Key type needs a manual implementation of the equivalent of Rust's PartialEq. Lots of types you'd want to use as keys don't have that implementation, but the LSP won't warn you about it.\nConversely, LSP errors don't guarantee that it won't compile. include errors especially seem to be false-positives about 95% of the time.\n\nIt's wild to me that people tolerate this kind of thing in the year 2025. I could write a whole \"Why is C++ dev UX still so terrible?\" article but I'll leave that for another day.\nSymbolFileNativePDB roadblocks#\n\nEven if we implement the new NativePDBASTParser interface for TypeSystemRust, it will never be called because SymbolFileNativePDB is hard-coded to get the language plugin for C++:\n\nThis isn't a simple problem to solve. I checked the DWARF parsers to see how they get the appropriate type system, and it's mostly the same only they call GetLanguage(*die.GetCU()) to get the language. Because of the extra ergonomics of the DIE object, it's easy to get any node's CompileUnit, and that compile unit contains the language. PDB data doesn't have such easy access.\nWhile we could just store the language of the first compile unit we see, that would likely break the type handling of binaries with FFI's. The correct solution would be to create a PDB equivalent to DIE and pass those around. The extra metadata and convenience functions would make handling this, and many other things, just as easy as with DWARF.\nUnfortunately, that's yet another layer of \"this is twice as much work as I thought\", so for now I've included a much shittier alternative. In every instance possible, pass a CompileUnit&amp;, even if it's just to pass it to a different function that needs it. For inherited functions where we can't change the function signature, we can take advantage of the fact that SymbolFileNativePDB stores maps of every symbol parsed. Each type of symbol has some way to access the compile unit or the language or both, so if we do lookups in every map we should eventually find the answer. We can also cache-for-our-sins so things don't end up too slow.\n\nIck.\nPerusing the rest of SymbolFileNativePDB's functions, it looks like there's some other processing that might be better handled by the ASTParser, but for the time being I'm going to Not Worry About It™.\nField Lists#\n\nThe fastest way to get &lt;something that compiles and runs&gt; is to parse primitives and structs so we have something to look at. Even if we ignore Decl and DeclContext, the debugger is still able to find functions, set breakpoints, and inspect local variables. There's not too much special about the primitives, but structs and their fields are a huge hassle. Sum types are structs with struct-fields and static fields, making them an even bigger hassle.\nThe culprit is, ironically, the lack of first-class sum types in C++. I think the CodeView API was written before C++17, so there's no use of std::variant. Instead, it's done through a sortof hacky use of generics. In Rust, you could (and indeed, can via the pdb2 crate) inspect type nodes as follows:\n\nIn LLVM, typically you'd use TypeDeserializer for this instead. Because it uses generics, you need to already know the type you want to deserialize. That means there's an awkward intermediate step\nwhere you have the node's tag and raw bytes in 1 object, then you need to create a new object that holds the deserialized version.\nAlso note the llvm::cantFail, which discards the error returned by deserializeAs. The error is sorta necessary because there's none of the valid-state-guarantees of a sum type, but the only way you'd ever want to use the API renders the error useless; an if {} else if {} implementation that tries every node type is going to be significantly slower than just switching on the node's tag.\n\nThat by itself isn't too bad, but keep it in mind while I explain field lists.\nIn the CodeView format, field lists are a separate type node that contains an array of 0 or more type nodes. The most common is the Member node, which is roughly a tuple of (name, offset, attributes, type_index). The nodes are padded within the list for some reason. To quote the CodeView spec:\n\nAs a program walks down the field list, the address of the next subfield is calculated by adding the length of the previous field to the address of the previous field. The byte at the new address is examined and if it is greater than 0xf0, the low four bits are extracted and added to the address to find the address of the next subfield.\n\nThe list can also be split into multiple parts, which are referenced via an LF_INDEX node that points to the rest of the list.\nAs you can imagine, parsing those by hand would be a bit annoying. Luckily there's a FieldListDeserializer struct. One tiny question: how the fuck am I supposed to use it? Take a gander at the constructor and the function signatures and keep in mind that there are zero comments in the containing file, TypeDeserializer.h. That header file contains the full implementations too, so that's all you get.\n\nThe macro magic expands to bespoke functions for every node that can exist in a field list. You pass in a reference to the appropriate record object and it fills it with the deserialized data.\nI'm not super versed on idiomatic C++, but I figured maybe this was a slightly awkward iterator implementation - visitMemberBegin giving you the current node and visitMemberEnd being the end of the list. Nope, not even a little. I looked up all the uses of FieldListDeserializer in the entirety of the LLVM mono-repo to get a hint. There is exactly 1, and it's not in TypeSystemClang's PDB handling. In llvm/lib/DebugInfo/LogicalView/Readers/LVCodeViewVisitor.cpp, it is used in a single function in a somewhat unhelpful way.\nThrough some trial and error with the assertions inside the visitMember_ functions, I was able to figure it out.\n\nYou wrap the field list's raw bytes in a BinaryStreamReader (~equivalent to Rust's Cursor) and pass a reference to the FieldListDeserializer constructor\nInside a loop, use the BinaryStreamReader to read the tag value, thus advancing the reader's position. You have to do this manually because even though FieldListDeserializer has the reader, the reader's position, and access to the TypeKind flag enum, it does not bother advancing the reader and reading the flag.\nIgnore the first loop, because the constructor also doesn't advance the reader past the LF_FIELD_LIST tag even though it checks that it's there.\nCall visitMemberBegin and pass in a CVMemberRecord with member.Kind set to the flag retrieved from step 2. This sets member.data to the appropriate span of raw bytes.\nSwitch on member.kind and do the deserializer dance with, for example a DataMemberRecord object, but with visitKnownMember instead of TypeDeserializer::deserializeAs\nProcess the data into the LangType of your choosing.\nMake sure to call all visitMemberEnd or else the next call to visitMemberBegin panics because some state variables inside the FieldListDeserializer aren't updated.\nDon't advance the reader by the size of member.data because the FieldListDeserializer handles that even though it doesn't automatically advance the reader anywhere else\n\nKnowing all that, the implementation is still a bit ugly. Mix that with sum-type handling and it turns into an absolute abomination. That's partially because Rust splits 128-bit discriminants into two 64-bit values that need to be stitched back together, and partially because sum-type variants are one of the few instances of the Rust compiler outputting forward declarations.\nSum Types#\n\nDWARF has nodes specifically for sum-types, which made generating them pretty easy for Rust and LLVM.\nCodeView has nothing of the sort. Or well, it does, but it's not publicly documented so Rust/LLVM don't generate the nodes for it and none of the existing parsers (except msdia140.dll?) can read it. Same difference.\nInstead, sum-types are generated as a \"hand-written\" tagged union with a nested struct for each variant, and a tag field for the discriminant. There is also a nested enum type that allows you to map the variant to its name. This diagram comes from the Rust compiler and is more or less what this looks like in C code:\n\nUnlike most other RustType representations, I purposefully stored sum-types in a format that is not a direct reading of the generated DWARF or PDB nodes. Put a different way, I don't store sum-types as if they're a regular union (which is stored as a RustAggregate). RustSumType is a unique variant with unique handling from other aggregate types. If I hadn't made this decision, we would have the same problem as TypeSystemClang: requiring 2 prettifiers on the front-end, one to handle DWARF sum-types and one to handle PDB sum-types.\nIt would also be difficult for the prettifiers to differentiate between regular aggregates and sum-type enums. With this arrangement, we can simply use the HardCodedSyntheticFinder to check a single value since RustType is just a wrapper around std::variant&lt;RustAggregate, RustSumType, ...&gt;.\nOne other funny issue I ran into is that I was storing enum discriminants in an llvm::DenseMap, which uses empty and tombstone values for the keys rather than something like Rust's Option type. Basically, they're designated values that mark \"this slot is empty\". For unsigned 64 bit integer types, these values are u64::MAX and u64::MAX - 1. Unfortunately, because enum values can be literally any value, that's not going to work. The simple solution is to wrap the values in std::optional, but I had to implement the DenseMapInfo template for that myself because it doesn't currently exist even though there's implementations for std::pair and std::tuple.\nModifying the DenseMap headers in basically any way triggers a full ~20-30 minute recompile of everything (Ryzen 9 7900, 64GB RAM, on an NVMe SSD) because it's used in so many places. And I have to recompile twice because I debug with a *-gnu build and do additional testing with an *-msvc build.\nOof.\nDecls and DeclContexts#\n\nAs far as I'm aware, the only instance of Rust outputting a static field in the debug info is for the *-msvc sum-type representation above. That might not always be the case though, so it's worth doing it right rather than adding an exception just for sum-types.\nTypeSystem::GetStaticFieldWithName is the \"front-end\" access point for static fields, which returns a CompilerDecl. That means we need a Decl struct that can also store a primitive value. If we're going to do that, we may as well refactor RustDecl and RustDeclContext entirely. In my last post I said that Decl objects only really need their name, their parent, and (in the case of DeclContext) their child Decls. While it's true that the TypeSystem will function with that info, there's more we could provide.\nPreviously, RustDecl and RustDeclContext were 2 halves of a std::variant that was then stuffed into a RustDeclBase struct. That layout starts to fall apart when you have things like function declarations, which are both a Decl (i.e. the function's signature is a RustType) and a DeclContext (because the function scope contains variable declarations, block declarations, etc.) so now it's just RustDecl with a bunch of variants based on the type of decl it is (e.g. VarDecl, TypeDecl, ValDecl). Everything contains exactly the data it needs and all the consumers are happy.\nType Discovery#\n\nAfter implementing all of that, I had some pretty promising output for primitive types and some structs. There were a few problems though. Reference and pointer types not populating correctly, Vec element synthetics would fail, that sort of thing.\nThis turned out to be a gigantic problem, or rather, 700 smaller problems in the world's largest trench coat.\nThe first problem, which contributes to a bunch of the later problems, is that we need to normalize the type names. Rust outputs slightly modified type names for *-msvc because Microsoft's debugger likes to read type names as expressions for some reason. This is why you'll see types like enum2$&lt;example::Enum&gt; or tuple$&lt;i32, Vec&lt;u8&gt; &gt;.\n\nAside: Fun fact, that space in &gt; &gt; isn't an accident. Microsoft's debugger would see &gt;&gt; as a right-shift operator, so the Rust compiler has to deliberately avoid that). It must also avoid { or &lt; at the beginning of a name, and any instance of #, [, or \"\n\nNormalizing the type names is not fun. It's fiddly, it's recursive, and small dumb issues keep cropping up. For brevity (as if I can make any claim to that now, 5000+ words in), I'm not going to go into too much detail. Feel free to check out the implementation if you're curious.\nIt is advantageous to normalize the names during the PDB parsing phase though because it reduces the public-facing differences between DWARF and PDB. The average user shouldn't need to type in ref$&lt;slice2$&lt;u8&gt; &gt; instead of &amp;[u8]. It also makes type lookups a bit easier, since we won't have to translate back and forth later if we store only the normalized names.\nPrimitives and Pointer types#\n\nRust does not output differentiated &amp;/&amp;mut/*const/*mut types. This is true for DWARF and PDB data - the debug info node generated is just a raw pointer (this also includes non-wide Box pointers). I've written a fix for this, but ironically the hacks required to get it to work with TypeSystemClang are what got me into this mess in the first place.\nIn any case, it leads to many type lookups failing. There are 3 crucial pieces of information involved in diagnosing and fixing this issue.\nFirst: The sole source of truth for what types exist when looking up a type in SymbolFileNativePDB is the PDB file itself, not the TypeSystem:\n\nThat means when we normalize names, the lookup function ignores them.\nSecond: PDB has explicit primitive nodes that directly map to the bit-width and signedness of the type, with no additional metadata. That means it doesn't exist as a top-level type in the PDB's type data. Even if it did, it wouldn't have the name \"u8\". Luckily, the Rust compiler does output the equivalent of typedef unsigned char u8;. That requires special handling though because PDB puts the typedef nodes in the Symbol data, not the Type data.\nThird: PDB pointer nodes do not have a name field at all. I had been outputting these as *mut T. When output as a generic arg, it uses the non-normalized name. That means you you have a Vec&lt;ref$&lt;u8&gt;&gt; a lookup of ref$&lt;u8&gt; or &amp;u8 would both fail even though there is a node for a pointer to an unsigned 8-bit integer, because the name of that pointer-to-8-bit-integer is *mut u8.\nOnce the Rust compiler properly outputs ref/pointer/mut information it shouldn't be a problem anymore, but for the time being it's easier to just generate types for all 4 kinds of indirection for every pointer node we see.\nStructs#\n\nThere's one additional lookup that runs into issues: almost every struct and enum type.\n\nSeems like a big thing to miss, but when inspecting local variables the type is stored with the variable. That means you only run into this issue if you specifically look up the type, which I hadn't done yet.\nTo keep things short and simple: when you request a type lookup, it eventually hits SymbolFileNativePDB::FindTypes, which accepts a const TypeQuery. TypeQuery contains the search value and some additional options. When you search example::Enum, the constructor of TypeQuery automatically splits it into \"context\" (example) and \"base name\" (Enum). The problem is that const TypeQuery only allows us to access the base name, or compare an existing ArrayRef&lt;ConstString&gt; (more or less) with the one that's privately stored inside the TypeQuery.\nThis is a pretty frustrating issue because the alternatives are all slow and these guard rails don't really need to exist. To sum up the problem, they've taken a specialized, optimized implementation and forced the entire API to conform to that instead of keeping the details as broad as possible, as long as possible, and only introducing the specialization at the exact layer where it's necessary.\nThe entire intention of TypeQuery's structure is to allow parsing scopes and types lazily. If you separate out the scope, the symbol file can search only that scope, and parse only the types in that scope.\nPDB does not work like that. PDB stores every single type in one giant list. That list is not in any way sorted or grouped. The types don't store back-references to their scope, nothing like that. In many cases (e.g. ref$&lt;example::Enum&gt;) even sorted types wouldn't help, because the type that Rust outputs \"doesn't exist\" within the type stream due to the reasons I discussed above.\nTypeQuery's specialization is not only incompatible with this, modifying the PDB handlers to take advantage of TypeQuery would make them slower than the naive implementation. That means I have a few options:\n\nInvent and store symbol context information that doesn't exist, and that I don't need anywhere else, so that I can check that it matches the context of the TypeQuery.\nCheck every type in my type list (and parse any type that hasn't been parsed), doing the same string manipulation that was done to the TypeQuery to split the name from the context and then comparing the result to the TypeQuery (this is what SymbolFileNativePDB currently does with the raw type stream).\nDo the reverse of that and stitch the TypeQuery context and base name back together, which requires modifying or friend-classing TypeQuery so I can bypass the guardrails.\nDo lookups via Decl/DeclContext, which requires naively chasing scopes through nested hashmaps. It might be faster if we could access the context array of the TypeQuery and specifically look only in the scopes we have, but const TypeQuery doesn't allow that so we'd need to create a scope graph of every single type that exists and one-by-one compare them against the TypeQuery's context. The other issue is that this would require delegating to the appropriate TypeSystem, but even though the TypeQuery stores the valid set of languages for the search, you can't just check that value, you can only check if a language is contained in that valid set.\n\nAll of those are drastically slower than my DenseMap&lt;ConstString, TypeSP&gt;. ConstString is an interned string, that means any comparison is a pointer + length comparison. Hashing them is trivial, so retrieving them from a hashmap is fast. I can't use the simple, fast solution because the data-prep step of a bespoke algorithm was done several public-API-steps before it was even necessary.\nIn any case, the least destructive way to fix this was to add a const function to TypeQuery that returns a const reference to the context array, allowing me to stitch the parts of the TypeQuery back together. My solution still isn't perfect because all types end up being looked up as if they are from 1 language even though that's not always true. Solving that would require a pretty gross system that would recursively check symbols/scopes of every compile unit and divvy out types (and types contained within those types) to their appropriate language/compile unit. Things like generic args, and especially types like ref$&lt;u8&gt; not existing in the type stream might throw a wrench in that, which is a big reason why I avoided it for now. Maybe something I can add later if it becomes a problem.\nThe final piece of the puzzle was \"when do we look for types?\". We know the generic exists the moment we have the type name, but looking them up during type processing leads to recursion problems. Adding in an \"are we already parsing this type\" check similar to DWARF parsing only lead to a bunch of other issues due to the ordering of types in the PDB file and the early exit for types we're already parsing. I think it could be solved with more effort and a larger re-write, but I just want to have &lt;something that compiles and runs&gt;, so we just leave the generics unresolved until they're specifically asked for (usually by the Synthetic Provider at prettification-time).\nWrapping up#\n\nAfter writing fixes for all of those problems, it compiles, it runs, and it shows me roughly what I expect to see.\nThis is another massive step towards a complete and upstream-able TypeSystemRust, but there's still a ways to go.\n\nI need to finish up the Synthetic Providers, at least to feature parity with Rust's current lldb_providers.py script.\nimplement several non-essential functions that I skipped over.\nfinalize the API for NativePDBASTParser and port TypeSystemClang to it.\ncreate a similar API for non-native PDBASTParser and implement that for both TypeSystemRust and TypeSystemClang OR add in a fallback that allows using Native if the language doesn't have a DIA parser.\nclean up the dozens of // TODO's, the memory leaks, the commented out code sections, etc.\nungodly amounts of documentation.\nadd tests, logging, and debug assertions.\nrebase onto a newer version of lldb (currently sitting on 19.x).\nmake some small changes to the Rust compiler for better debug node generation\n\nDifferentiate &amp;/&amp;mut/*const/*mut.\nGenerate typedefs for types that aren't directly output in the PDB type nodes (e.g. ref$&lt;example::Type&gt;).\nGenerate nodes for value-generics (e.g. the 2 in SmallVec&lt;T, 2&gt;).\nGenerate a bespoke node or typedef for non-wide Box&lt;T&gt;\n\n\n\nand probably a few other odds and ends that I'm forgetting. I'm optimistic though. I definitely feel like I'm over the hump. The biggest challenges so far stemmed from having to do tons of exploratory work to figure out how things work. With the vast majority of that out of the way (hopefully), the rest should be smooth sailing.\n\nOne final note: I apologize for the poor quality of the C++ syntax highlighting. All the syntax highlighting on this site is handled via sublime-syntax files that I modify myself to improve their output (or I write them myself in some simple cases). Rust required a few hours of modifications and it looks great. C/C++ are not trivial languages to parse and the existing sublime-syntax files, frankly, suck really bad. They are a huge mess and C++ especially has a lot of syntax and edge cases. Fixing it would be a nightmare, but writing one from scratch is very hard to justify.\nI could always paste the code into my editor and copy-paste the raw HTML into my blog but that seems both unsustainable and silly.\nSo for now, as much as I hate it, C++ is just kinda gonna look bad.\n","id":"https://walnut356.github.io/posts/lldbs-typesystems-pt-2/","title":"LLDB's TypeSystems Part 2: PDB"},"https://walnut356.github.io/posts/partial-borrow-pointer-ub/":{"body":"Partial borrows across function boundaries don't really work in Rust. Unfortunately, that's kind of a major issue. There are workarounds, some are outlined here, but all of them come with pretty major drawbacks.\n\nInlining is a nightmare for obvious reasons. Factoring ruins your struct layout (which could matter a lot for performance reasons), and can make your code substantially less readable as related information is no longer packed together, or the internal relationships end up mangled.\nFree (or associated) functions are just awful. They break encapsulation, they interact awkwardly with the surrounding code, and they're far easier to make mistakes with. If I call self.lookup(), I can look at the constraints of self and lookup() and know that the function is infallible. An associated function that just takes a generic reference to a hashmap may panic due to .get().unwrap() because someone wasn't paying attention and tossed any ol' hashmap in there. The whole point of methods is to prevent putting nonsense data into highly constrained functions, and it's frustrating having to work around such a glaring hole in Rust's (usually) clear and convenient semantics.\nI don't have a ton of experience with view structs, but at the very least they're a bit of extra legwork and split the logic code between multiple different structs.\nIn the back of my mind has always sat the idea that I have an escape-hatch with raw pointers. This sort of \"partial borrow\" issue would be non-existent in C, and pointers are pointers, so there shouldn't be any real issue in Rust. I held back partially because I never came across an instance of partial borrows annoying enough that it justified the other annoyance of using unsafe, partially because the documentation around pointers makes it a little unclear if the way I wanted to do things is instantly UB or not, and partially because any time I ask questions about unsafe in public forums, people get very condescending and preachy. It makes it very hard to learn when the information is being obfuscated by \"if you need unsafe for something like this, your code is structured wrong\" and \"If I had review rights, I would reject any code that looked like this\". I want to go on a bit of a tangent and share my thoughts about this sort of mentality. If you aren't interested, feel free to skip to the meat of the post.\nBy nature, I'm a very methodical person. I like clearly defined rules, well justified reasons behind those rules, and a thorough enough understanding that I can apply my knowledge to any situation - including when to bend or break the rules. At least for me, that sort of understanding can only come from careful prodding and experimentation. Stringently following exactly what the \"best practices\" are just isn't good enough - memorization and following instructions aren't the same as learning. What if the limits I was told were inaccurate, poorly worded, or overly cautious? Even if I eventually settle into following best practices, I have to know they're \"best\", and that only comes with experience. That may sound like a lot of unnecessary work. In some ways I guess it is. But I've found that, even outside of programming, established convention ends up being the willfully-ignorant-\"we've always done it this way\" variety just as often as it's been genuine wisdom. It might take me longer to get my bearings when trying something new, but I've always felt I come out the other end ahead of those who stay unquestioningly within the box of common practice.\nOne of the first programming videos I ever watched was about \"Forbidden\" C++ by javidx9. It's also one of my favorite programming videos I've ever watched. If you're strapped for time, this video goes over things like global variables, void pointers, and memory leaks. The purpose is demystifying these \"bad practices\" by explaining exactly why something like a global variable is considered bad practice, and giving legitimate use-cases for them. Most importantly, he assures the viewer that it's okay to experiment. As he says in another excellent video\n\nRemember, the tools work for you, and you can't hurt them... break the rules. Use global variables all over the place. Use unsafe system calls. Don't check all your integers to make sure they're within range. This is stuff they will not advise you to do at school.\nWell you know what? It doesn't matter! You're learning! You're not gonna cause any harm. You're not going to break your computer (mostly). The computer doesn't have feelings, you're not going to upset it, and your code isn't being reviewed by somebody on the internet. It doesn't matter! Do whatever you need to do to get the job done... Get yourself into a real mess - there's no greater mental challenge for a programmer than debugging stuff. And if you want a career as a programmer, you're going to be debugging a lot of stuff... if you can get yourself out of it, that journey will have presented so much new learning to you. And if you get really stuck, select all, delete, start again... The best way to learn is to make mistakes.\n\nThis was far and away the most liberating thing I heard when I was brand new to programming, and parts of this quote echo in my mind nearly every time I open up my IDE. The world won't end if my program is a little grimy. Learning is more important than idealized perfection, especially on a personal project.\nWhen first starting out, undefined behavior was this \"boogeyman\" that lurked behind seemingly innocuous code. It could jump out from anywhere, do anything, at any time. The more I've learned about compilers (and I'm no expert by any means), the more I dislike that view. Compilers are not magic, they don't turn your code into nonsense on a whim. Even the consequences of the UB are \"predictable\" in the sense that there's literally a reason that your compiler chose to modify the code the way it did, and there is a completely understandable chain of events that lead to the unexpected outcome. You might not know what that reason is, but that doesn't make it random chance. It was incorrect assumptions on the programmer's end, combined with a strict boundary for what constitutes \"valid state and behavior\" in a system that, while outside the programmer's control, is in somebody's control. I think this perspective made more sense back when there were less protections around memory access (e.g. read/write/execute flags), but I certainly don't think it holds to the same degree today.\nUndefined behavior - the tangible consequences of violating a language's rules and assumptions - is obfuscated by the fact that it's a negative space of sorts. I think it's easy to lose sight of the boundary itself and assume that something is UB just because it's relatively close to that boundary. Even reading Rust's specifications isn't enough - words themselves are open to interpretation, whereas the boundary literally isn't. Even if it hasn't been vocally defined, even if nobody knows that it's there, it still exists. The program either violates the compiler's assumptions or it doesn't. It is not random chance whether a program can or cannot produce undefined behavior, even if the consequences manifest sporadically. Assuming compilers are deterministic, UB is also consistent in the sense that if you change nothing about your program and compiler, that miscompilation will continue to happen.\nWhew, that was quite the tangent. Hopefully that makes it clear why I would bother doing something like this in the first place. I won't be fully satisfied with any solution I choose until I tie up this loose end and figure out if it works or not. Even if it's not the best solution in this exact case, I'll still have learned something about the boundary of undefined behavior.\nThe partial borrow problem#\n\nI started looking into this due to borrow-checker wrestling in the Starcraft Simulator, specifically when adding in buffs/debuffs. We have a Coordinator struct, which contains 2 Army structs (and some miscellaneous metadata). Each Army struct looks roughly like this:\n\nbase_units is a hashmap that contains the immutable stats of each unit type (max health, what weapons the unit can use, etc.). units is a flat vec, accessed via integer handles, and contains all of the data that can change over the course of a fight. It's important to note that this is a \"setup -&gt; run -&gt; inspect\" situation. Once the setup phase is complete, .base_units and .units will never change size (and thus never be reallocated), are never rearranged, and the contained structs are never assigned to, only individual fields in those structs (e.g. never army.units[i] = ..., only army.units[i].field = ...). For now we can pretend state looks like this:\n\nWhat I want to implement is Concussive Shell, a non-stacking debuff on the marauder's attack that slows any unit it hits by 50%. These types of stat modifiers are represented in memory by the Effect enum. As this is a prototype, Effect only has one variant, so we can pretend it's actually just a struct that looks like this:\n\nstat tells us which part of State is being modified (useful when we remove the effect). timestamp is the time at which the Effect wears off and needs to be removed. Each tick, the coordinator checks the timestamps of each effect on each unit in each army, and removes the effect when necessary. \"Removing an effect\" in this instance isn't as straightforward as just setting the stat back to its default value, as we need to consider units with multiple effects that each modify the same stat (e.g. a zealot whose speed is boosted by charge, but lowered by concussive shell). The simplest way I could think to do this was by fully recalculating the stat each time a modifier is removed. There aren't a whole lot of buffs/debuffs in starcraft, and as far as I know there aren't any that stack, so I don't think it's the end of the world computationally or storage-wise.\nThat manifests in the Coordinator, with the following function:\n\nIterating over army.units holds a borrow over army. A call to army.reset_speed(unit) requires borrowing &amp;mut army as well, resulting in a compiler error.\nA similar problem manifests in reset_speed(). As a reminder, in this is a prototype we're only dealing with the speed stat, but it won't always be that way. These functions have a bit of added complexity when dealing with other stat types, which is why we'll need a full mutable borrow on state if we want effect.apply to be fully \"generic\".\n\nSame deal, &amp;state.effects borrows from state, but we also need to pass state mutably into effect.apply.\n\nAside: I know these can both be solved in safe rust via indexing, but as I said before, this is at least partially an academic pursuit. It's also worth noting that this has some ergonomic downsides, since I can't use iterator methods like .filter(). I'll include the safe versions of these functions later on after we talk more about the compiler.\n\nThis is where the escape hatch comes in. As the programmer, this is a pretty trivial case. With state being the same as army.units[i], we really only have:\n\na read from state.base (which is just a Copy enum)\na read from army.base_units[base].movement.speed\na write to state.effects immediately before reset_speed\na read from state.effects within reset_speed\na write to state.max_speed (or some other stat that is guaranteed not to overlap with state.effects) within effect.apply\n\nNone of these conflict in an absolute sense - we're not changing any values that we already have an immutable reference to, and none of the mutable values overlap. In C it would be trivial to hook this up, and it would look pretty similar to a Rust implementation that used free functions. To get the same behavior via Rust we can bypass the borrow checker using raw pointers. To maintain regular Rust ergonomics, we can turn the pointer back into a ref. Note that the return-type coerces the lifetime to a different lifetime than the value passed in.\n\n\n\nIf I was purely working in raw pointers, that would be the end of the story I think, as raw pointers don't carry the same guarantees as mutable references. The fact that I'm casting it back to a reference and I'm \"using\" other references to the struct is the real issue.\nTo be clear, this is already very unsafe. Any mistakes in logic will result in UB, even if accessing the unsafe_mut ref and &amp;mut self at the same time isn't instant UB by itself. It's not just bypassing the borrow checker, we're giving it the middle finger. Rust will continue to uphold borrow checker rules about val as if val is not currently accessible anywhere else, so any incorrect assumptions are very dangerous.\nWith these functions we no longer have to hold borrows to army and state while iterating over army.units and state.effects. That frees us up to call methods and pass them around without any trouble. At least, without any trouble from the borrow checker. Compiler trouble is another issue.\nFun note, after starting this blog post I found another repo using similar functions in the wild: amazon's official Rust parser for the Ion data format. It's not quite the same since the behavior is split between two functions, but I still thought it was a funny coincidence.\nBut is there undefined behavior?#\n\nIt's complicated. My gut instinct was \"no\". After reading the docs for raw pointers it was \"probably yes\". After consulting some community members, we agreed \"almost definitely yes\". After doing a few nights of research and a lot of staring at a wall, my answer was \"probably no\". Now though? My answer is \"who knows\". And that's kind of a genuine question. I don't think this information is centralized anywhere aside from a few people's brains, and that might be intentional. Researching this took me down quite a few rabbit holes, stretching my knowledge of compilers pretty well past its breaking point. Forgive me if I've misunderstood or misinterpreted things. As I'm doing my \"final\" pass before posting this, I am still reading literature from experts about how this sort of thing works. This turned from a \"I'm gonna take a day to whine about this minor annoyance in my fruit salad text\" to \"oh god it's been weeks and I'm still rewriting sections\". Take all of this with the largest grain of salt you can find. If anything major is pointed out, I'll edit the post.\nRust's Rules#\n\nThe first place to look is std::ptr, which offers this bit of wisdom:\n\nWhether a pointer is valid depends on the operation it is used for (read or write), and the extent of the memory that is accessed (i.e., how many bytes are read/written) – it makes no sense to ask “is this pointer valid”; one has to ask “is this pointer valid for a given access”\n\nI hinted at this above when describing the escape hatch in terms of reads and writes rather than pointers. This is echoed in a fantastic blog post by the author of the nomicon and Learning Rust With Entirely Too Many Linked Lists:\n\nThe primary function of aliasing is as a model for when the compiler can semantically cache memory accesses. This can either mean assuming a value in memory hasn’t been modified or assuming a write to memory isn’t necessary...Now it’s often clumsy to talk about accesses aliasing, so we usually talk about pointers aliasing as a shorthand... The reason that the actual model is in terms of accesses and not pointers is because that’s the thing that we care about.\n\nSince passing around the pointers doesn't matter if we don't use them, getting a ref via unsafe_mut and then calling a function that takes &amp;mut self and that unsafe ref likely isn't UB so long as we don't access &amp;mut self.\nBack to the pointer documentation:\n\nThe precise rules for validity are not determined yet.\n\nOh. Well shit.\nThis is a large part of why I can't put a 100% guarantee on anything I'm saying. The language itself isn't making guarantees, and experts are still investigating various parts of the semantics to this day. I am not an expert, I'm just a dude who spends inordinate amounts of his free time investigating stupid things for stupid reasons. As such, I will continue to dig, as I think I can make a more solid case than \"Iunno, it seems fine\". Not too much more solid though, as we're diving directly into semantics hell.\nSince all of my refs are derived from pointers which are derived from valid refs, and this is a single-threaded application, the only relevant part of the minimal outline given by the pointer documentation is the last one:\n\nThe result of casting a reference to a pointer is valid for as long as the underlying object is live and no reference (just raw pointers) is used to access the same memory. That is, reference and pointer accesses cannot be interleaved.\n\nWhich doesn't actually help that much. In this case I think we can assume that ref -&gt; ptr -&gt; ref is functionally identical to ref -&gt; ptr. We access army.units through a pointer, and state.effects through a pointer, but that's interleaved with a regular &amp;mut army to call reset_speed and check a value in army.base_units. In the blog post I linked earlier, she says that \"generally you should avoid mixing references and unsafe pointers\". So uh, that doesn't quite give a firm yes or no either, and somewhat contradicts the official docs. I think this has to do with stacked borrows (i.e. how miri currently tracks memory access), but I'm not going to get into that here because it's a whole can of worms.\nBut what does accessing \"the same memory\" mean exactly? For that matter, what does \"access\" mean? It's easy to say \"a read or a write\", but what does that mean? If I pass &amp;mut army to a method, does that access the pointer? In my eyes, unless the method is dynamically dispatched I don't think anything physically in memory is being read or written, and that's what matters according to the Rust and LLVM docs. What about accessing a field of army? Does that count as reading the whole struct, or just the field? In a local scope it only accesses the field, but is that a special compiler trick?\nThe opinion of the community members I asked was that &amp;mut army effectively does count as accessing all of army, regardless of how it's used in the function. This was explained via split_at_mut, and how it returns 2 new objects at the same time, thus only ever requiring 1 borrow of the original slice. The more I think about that, the less I agree with it though. I think that it works that way so that it is 100% safe - the intention of split_at_mut is that you cannot access the original slice while you're accessing the 2 halves of it. But not being 100% safe doesn't immediately mean UB.\nAnother thread we can investigate is the rust reference's section on Behavior Considered Undefined. It's not exhaustive, but still has some new info we haven't covered yet. To quickly run down the list:\n\nWe have no data races because it's single threaded\nThe pointers are made from valid refs, so they cannot be dangling or misaligned\nWe're accessing fields through regular . syntax, so we cannot violate in-place pointer arithmetic rules\nWe might be breaking LLVM's pointer aliasing rules, especially since we're not using UnsafeCell, but I'll talk about this one in more detail below\nWe might be mutating \"immutable\" bytes? This has to do with \"pointer provenance transitivity\" (holy hell), which I'll get into later\nWe're not using compiler intrinsics\nWe're not cross compiling or using architecture-specific features\nWe're not interacting with any external functions, so there's nowhere to use the wrong ABI in a function call\nWe're not producing any invalid values\nWe're not using inline assembly\nThis is not a const context\n\nLLVM's rules#\n\nThe two rules that we might be breaking depend on what it means for a pointer value is \"based on\" another pointer value. The main statement we're worried about is this:\n\nPointer Aliasing Rules: Any memory access must be done through a pointer value associated with an address range of the memory access, otherwise the behavior is undefined... A pointer value is associated with the addresses associated with any value it is based on... A pointer value formed from a scalar getelementptr operation is based on the pointer-typed operand of the getelementptr... The \"based on\" relationship is transitive.\n\nThe wording of \"based on\" is a bit obtuse, but I assume it's the same thing as what the Rust docs call \"provenance\", and it involves the (apparently) infamous getelementptr LLVM instruction. The reference straight up says that the instruction is very confusing, and has dedicated documentation to clarify things that is also very confusing. To be fair, that's not LLVM's fault, it's mine for digging into this without the requisite contextual knowledge.\nThe one hitch in this is that the Rust docs talk about \"shrinking\" provenance, which seems to somewhat contradict the LLVM docs' \"associated with the addresses associated with any value it is based on\":\n\nProvenance is implicitly shared with all pointers transitively derived from The Original Pointer through operations like offset, borrowing, and pointer casts. Some operations may shrink the derived provenance, limiting how much memory it can access or how long it’s valid for (i.e. borrowing a subfield and subslicing).\n\nTo sum up my understanding of this, &amp;mut foo.bar counts as being associated with all of &amp;mut foo, since the operand of getelementptr is the pointer to foo. Any subset pointer (e.g. &amp;mut bar.baz) is also associated with all of &amp;mut foo due to transitivity. But GEP-ing a field restricts the memory range that pointer the is allowed to access to some subset of foo. I read this as meaning that accessing data within foo via those pointers at all is valid, but it's invalid to take a pointer to foo2 and offset it such that writing to it will write to foo.bar.\nAs far as I can tell, this says nothing about how and when the pointed-to data can be accessed if you have multiple pointers to that same data, only that LLVM expects to be able to \"know\" where each pointer came from, and that its access is in-bounds. In strict terms, GEP is just pointer arithmetic, not an access. To put it in a more intuitive way, I think LLVM expects to be able to \"undo\" any pointer arithmetic to figure out what the base pointer is. If I understand correctly, LLVM doesn't have the concept of types or objects when referring to pointers, only addresses and access ranges, so I think this logic tracks.\nThe next hint we get is from the LLVM's documentation of noalias which states:\n\nMemory locations accessed via pointer values based on the argument or return value are not also accessed, during the execution of the function, via pointer values not based on the argument or return value. This guarantee only holds for memory locations that are modified...The attribute on a return value also has additional semantics...On function return values, the noalias attribute indicates that the function acts like a system memory allocation function, returning a pointer to allocated storage disjoint from the storage of any other object accessible to the caller.\n\nThis specifically deals with argument and return pointers, and that mutably accessing data is allowed (even under noalias) so long as it's only ever accessed by pointers based on the argument/return value. Honestly, the wording on this is pretty bad. I have 2 mutable pointers, and they are both clearly based on the same self.army, and (in theory) both could access the same data. Remember when I said semantics hell? Prepare yourself, this one's a disaster. LLVM's wording can be read in 2 different ways:\n\nPessimistically, if a noalias pointer is passed into a function, any and all accesses to those bits must be made from pointers that are GEP'd from the passed-in-pointer within the function (i.e. nothing else passed in can access those bits, and no globals can either)\nOptimistically, if 2 noalias pointers are passed into a function and both point to the same memory, accesses are fine so long as they are both \"obviously\" based on the same pointer\n\nPart of the reason this ambiguity exists is because LLVM docs say that noalias is \"intentionally similar to the definition of restrict in C99\". C99 restrict is what allows the compiler to cache memory reads when multiple pointers are passed to a function. If it said it was \"identical to\", I could for sure say \"okay, the pessimistic take is the correct one\". Instead, well... I don't know. The optimistic take could be true if LLVM is smart enough to do meta-analysis on individual call-sites and ignore the noalias declaration (and thus noalias-based optimizations) where appropriate. That could be a ridiculous line of reasoning, but to me it doesn't sound that farfetched considering how explicit the \"based on\" relationship is when using GEP, and this whole article that talks about how the \"based on\" relationship is tracked to some degree, and that certain operations can muddy that tracking. It all depends on if noalias is treated as an invariant guaranteed by the programmer, or as a hint that allows potential optimization.\nFinally, we can look at the definitions of the !noalias and !alias.scope decorators in LLVM's intermediate representation:\n\n!noalias and !alias.scope metadata provide the ability to specify generic noalias memory-access sets. This means that some collection of memory access instructions (loads, stores, memory-accessing calls, etc.) that carry !noalias metadata can specifically be specified not to alias with some other collection of memory access instructions that carry !alias.scope metadata.\n\nWhat this allows is the defining of selective aliasing of non-argument/return value pointers. Adding these attributes to a pointer creates the fine-grained control of \"this pointer might alias with any other pointer in the program, but it can be guaranteed not to alias with this other pointer (or set of pointers) right here\".\nTo sum all of this up:\n\nPointers, according to LLVM, are an address and the number of bytes they can access\nGEP (i.e. getting a reference to a struct's field from a reference to a struct) is just pointer arithmetic and does not count as a read or write\nAll of the below rules are ~irrelevant if you only ever access via 1 pointer\n(assuming the conservative interpretation) noalias on a pointer passed into a function assumes the pointed-to-value is not modified via anything other the passed-in-pointer during the function\nnoalias on a return pointer means that the caller assumes the pointer is completely unique (and thus cannot be accessed via any other previously existing pointer)\nLLVM does &lt;some form of meta analysis&gt; that tracks pointers at least a little bit, and applies !noalias and !alias.scope within (and across) functions to make explicit aliasing relationships\n\nLLVM IR#\n\nAll of the above information is very cool, but none of it means anything if we don't know how Rust is communicating with LLVM, and thus how LLVM sees our code. Even looking at the raw assembly won't help, since these are invariants that are reflected through Rust semantics and LLVM-IR decorators. Luckily, cargo-show-asm also has output for both LLVM-IR and pre-pass LLVM-IR. The latter is essentially before any optimizations or code transformations, and it doesn't contain any !noalias or !alias.scope decorators. While we can view the reset_speed and tick_effects functions both pre- and post-pass, unsafe_mut doesn't actually do anything and thus is optimized out (even with #[inline(never)]). That means we can only view it pre-pass:\n\nWow, that certainly is some syntax...\n\nAside: The blog-builder I use didn't even have highlighting for it, and there isn't a sublime-syntax for it that I could find in the wild. I tried some vscode extensions to get a feel for what it might look like, but those could only really manage \"everything's a variable or a keyword\" which is... unhelpful. Syntax highlighting should at least hint at the relationships between various tokens. In the end I just went ahead and wrote a sublime-syntax file myself that hopefully isn't quite so hideous.\n\nIn particular, I want to point out 2 things. First is that the returned value is literally a copy of the passed in value.\n\nI'm not 100% sure if this (and/or this getting optimized out) ends up erasing the \"based on\" relationship of the original pointer somewhere along the line, but I don't think so.\nSecond, and more importantly, is the return type of the function:\n\nYou'll notice that it does not have a noalias tag. That means we can ignore the return position noalias restrictions entirely. Also, the dereferenceable(24) refers to the number of bytes that the pointer is allowed to legally access. It's of size 24 because both of our unsafe_mut calls are references to vecs.\nBefore getting to the post-pass, it's worth noting that this is what a call to into_iter looks like in LLVM-IR:\n\nAll it does is return pointers to the first element, and 1 past the last element of the passed-in array. army.units is considered noalias inside the function of into_iter, but the return pointers are not. That means LLVM does not expect state to be inaccessible by other existing pointers.\n\nFull tick_effects LLVM-IR\n\n\n\nNext we'll want to check the callsites of the functions that consume refs based on unsafe refs - reset_speed and effect.apply\n\nBoth the pointer to army (%_11) and the pointer to state (%iter.sroa.0.08.i6) are marked as noalias, which seems like it might be an issue. If you consider it carefully, this doesn't actually violate LLVM's expectations. According to LLVM &amp;mut army is simply a pointer to 144 bytes, and &amp;mut state is a pointer to 88 bytes. We, as the programmer, know that these bytes do not overlap in any way, since &amp;mut state is a pointer to a heap-allocated array element, whereas coordinator (and thus army) is on the stack. While state was originally accessed via an overlapping pointer to army.units, we have arranged things in such a way that no writes are made to any of the bytes that a pointer to army.units would imply (i.e. the 24 byte footprint of the vec itself) until control returns back to tick_effects.\n\nFull reset_speed LLVM-IR\n\n\n\n\nSame deal for effect.apply. state is not accessed by any other pointer during the execution of apply, it doesn't overlap with the effects iterator (which is a pointer to a different allocation on the heap), and the effects footprint-bytes are not written to.\nSpeculation#\n\nIf everything above is accurate and I'm not misunderstanding anything, I think my exact usage is not UB under any circumstance. Even assuming the most pessimistic view - that accessing &amp;mut foo.baz still counts as \"overlapping access\" with every other part of &amp;mut foo - it's clear that any access to &amp;mut army from within reset_speed does not overlap with &amp;mut state in any way. &amp;mut state is allocated on the heap, completely disjoint from &amp;mut army. I would have to interleave access via &amp;mut state with accessing the same memory via &amp;mut army.units[i] or resize the vec for there to be any real problems. To generalize, for any struct\n\ns.method(unsafe_mut(&amp;s.b)) should not result in UB so long as you don't access b through &amp;mut s inside the method. If b is a pointer to a vec, and the unsafe reference passed in is unafe_mut(&amp;mut s.b[i]), accessing b, and even b[x] through &amp;mut s within the method should be fine, but only so long as b never changes sizes (which may result in a reallocation) and x != i. This is at least partially supported via miri, which only errors out when I intentionally interleave access to a value between &amp;mut self and the unsafe_mut reference.\nI don't think it's as straight forward if b is just a regular, non-pointer value. We're technically violating an assumption - the pointers that we're passing in do overlap - but accesses are what matter, not pointers, so as long as we're careful not to actually modify overlapping bits it should be fine. It all depends on what kinds of things Rust is doing in it's MIR - how its extra invariants are expressed and how those are translated to LLVM-IR. Maybe it's 100% not UB and I'm overthinking it, who knows. I still don't feel like I entirely grasp the semantics behind !alias.scope and !noalias.\nIt's probably safe to say that if you call a function s.method(unsafe_mut(&amp;mut s.a)), observing the pointed-to-value of b and even changing the pointer of s.b is fine, since accessing s.b is a \"shrinking\" GEP. That said, assigning to the whole struct (*s = s2) is very likely UB. There might be some exceptions to that if, for example, s2.a == s.a but uh... \"does a write count as an aliasing access even if the bits written are the same as the bits that were already there?\" is some next level semantics that I'm not even gonna touch.\nEither way, it was fun looking into how LLVM works. There were a lot of cool realizations along the way - a lot more of Rust is \"smoke and mirrors\" meant to massage the LLVM-IR than I expected. If this trick isn't UB, it's probably pretty handy for prototyping. That's a pretty big \"if\" though.\nI mentioned before that there's safe versions of my example functions, which I'll put in an expand-o down below. They use indexing rather than iterators so they don't hold long-term borrows. We also pass the state handle to reset_speed instead of &amp;mut state. The ASM and LLVM_IR generated are more or less identical between the safe and unsafe versions, accounting for register shuffling and a bit of panic handling for the array indexing.\n\nSafe tick_effects\n\n\n\n\nSafe reset_speed\n\n","id":"https://walnut356.github.io/posts/partial-borrow-pointer-ub/","title":"Bypassing the borrow checker - do ref -> ptr -> ref partial borrows cause UB?"},"https://walnut356.github.io/posts/protoss-cost-efficiency/":{"body":"To keep the preamble brief, I did a bunch of digging and analysis a year or two ago and never did anything with the data. I wrote an app, compiled spreadsheets, drafted (and deleted) many documents. Most recently, I had planned to write something more formal - akin to a patch proposal (the actual \"patch notes\" and data at will be at the bottom, they're vaguely interesting but they're some context). I don't think I have it in me to do something so ambitious on this topic anymore. Unfortunately, the conclusions I've drawn from that data will continue to bang around in my head until I say something. This will be an informal \"post-mortem\" of sorts, thus my focus is more on sharing my thought process and conclusions, rather than presenting a compelling argument meant to convince. You'll have to meet me half way on that front. If you're wondering who I am and/or my qualifications: I'm nobody and have none.\nWith that out of the way, on to the good stuff:\nWhere we are now#\n\nProtoss is kinda a joke. Even the biggest of protoss detractors have been coming around to the idea that the race is in the worst state any race has been in since WoL's release. It all boils down to 2 interlinked issues:\n\n\nProtoss is designed like garbage and isn't really fun to play as or against\n\n\nProtoss is very weak\n\n\nWhile the first issue has almost always been true, the second has been slowly creeping up on us for a long, long time. I want to explain what \"weak\" means, because I think it'll probably be controversial to say protoss has been weak since sc2 released. To help tide you over until I get to the point, ponder this: has protoss's core design changed much since WoL?\nMy core idea should be clear from the title of the article: protoss simply isn't cost efficient. I think right now, that's fairly obvious based on the existance of the disruptor. It's a unit thats sole purpose is to periodically delete portions of your opponent's army. It's a reload-able baneling that 1shots most units in the game. It is incredibly cheap for its potential and isn't really that hard to use effectively. And yet despite having one of the most absurd unit designs I've ever seen in an RTS, protoss wasn't completely busted. It follows then that everything around the disruptor must be equivalently underwhelming. If disruptors are the kings of cost efficiency, then everything else protoss has must be the paupers.\nAssuming both players are competent and playing reasonable build orders, they should have roughly the same amount of resources at the same time. Assuming they spend their money in a reasonable way and play equally well, their armies should be of equal strength and any engagement should be decided by the context surrounding that engagement. To clarify, while the armies should be overall similar \"strength\", they'll likely be good at different things. A mech army will want a different kind of engagement than a bio army, a blink-based army will favor different terrain and engagement styles than an equivalent chargelot-archon-based army.\nI'm not going to bother establishing at length that this isn't true for protoss right now - it's obvious enough. The long and short of it really is the whole \"deleting portions of your opponent's army just to make the game even\" thing. It was kept in careful balance until recently, and the series of nerfs to the disruptor (without equivalent compensatory buffs to surrounding units) have finally collapsed the house of cards. Instead, I want to spend some time proving that this has always been the case, it has just been masked by a set of increasingly contrived cries for help.\nWhere we used to be#\n\nLet's assume the same situation as above, except you're aware that your army is weaker than theirs, and there's no possible way to rectify that. How do you win anyway? You play smarter. Exploit the types of engagements, the terrain, the timing that your opponent's army can't handle well. Get scrappy, get crafty, get weird. Claw for any way to unbalance their position. Everyone does this to some extent, but it becomes the only way when you can't win a straight-up fight.\nSo what about before the disruptor, back in HotS? The predominant strategy in PvZ was mostly variants of blinkstalker sentry. There were some weirdos like myself who played 9 colossus mothership vs swarmhosts on gigantic 4 player maps, but I think most people agree that blinkstalker sentry was not only the most common, but the most effective. For those that weren't around, or those that forgot, here is my favorite game of all time: Parting vs True game 3 at Gfinity 2015 (skip to ~16:45 if you're impatient). That game alone just about sums up HotS to me.\nBlink is the best ability in the game. Put it on any unit, and that unit is incredible. Forcefield is also stupidly strong in isolation. Combining these (and recall) is the pinnacle of hit and run cost efficiency - it's hard to imagine a better set of abilities. Despite that, it barely worked. I don't mean that it was too weak, I mean on the whole it was a very fragile strategy - balance-wise - that was reliable enough to be a mainstay, but there's no hidden extra layer or whatever that makes it broken or can be adapted if things change. A single nerf to stalkers or sentries could, and indeed did, kill this strategy outright.\nCan't out-greed? Make your opponent bleed off money constantly, put pressure on any auxiliary bases. Can't take straight up engagements? Hit and run, trade shields for HP. Can't hit and run without losing more than you kill? Use forcefields to only fight tiny sections of the army, in combination with blink to retreat when necessary. Force everything to be on your terms and maybe you can swing the pendulum in your favor and wear them down. It's an exciting style to watch and play, and is represented by the other races in the MMM vs ling bane muta wars that have nearly always existed in the meta.\nThis strategy unfortunately no longer works in LotV as ravagers ruin the delicate sentry energy math. The composition can no longer trade effectively with large numbers of low/mid tier units. In effect though, disruptors are a streamlined version of forcefielding off a handful of roaches and killing them \"for free\".\nThe other option is to go lategame and hope to weather the storm until such a time as core armies aren't primarily made of up of t1/1.5 units, and when production and tech limitations no longer exist. Some players were very successful with this strategy, but it's still just masking the cost efficiency issue by avoiding confrontation rather than min-maxing every little aspect of it.\nBefore that, in WoL, play was much the same. People were generally worse at the game, both executionally, and mentally. Play revolved around mostly turtling to avoid fighting with primarly t1/1.5-based armies, gimmicks like archon toilet, or early all-ins like the Soul Train which, surprise surprise, relies on forcefields to eke out an advantage via the same tactics as above.\nThe other major playstyle throughout sc2's history was cheese. If you can't win engagements on the map, why let it get there in the first place? I wonder which race was the most infamous for cheese...\nUnfortunately, because of this infamy, Protoss cheeses and all ins were targeted and patched more aggressively than those of Terran and Zerg (see: treatment of adept all ins vs nydus all ins at the beginning of LotV).\nThe point#\n\nWhile the previous section was by no means extensive, I think those of you who have been around for a while can recognize the pattern and fill in the gaps with your own experience. There are all sorts of problems that have come up as a result of the lack of cost efficiency:\n\n\nOver centralization on colossus, high templar, or carriers\n\nIf you have them, fights feel even. Once they die, the other 90% of your army may as well not exist\n\n\n\nFrail earlygame\n\nSee: WoL PvP earlygame and the forge fast expand for examples, and mothership core+photon overcharge/shield batteries+battery overcharge for bandaid fixes.\n\n\n\nDoubling down on annoying/gimmicky unit design\n\n\nLack of compositional and strategic variety\n\nMany niche units fall by the wayside and are completely unused, most compositions are just miniscule variations of the 2 cost effective units + whatever hard counter you need at the time\n\n\n\ndeleting portions of your opponent's army being a necessity\n\n\nInfrastructure feels too expensive\n\nLots of tech is required which leads to less production structures. Less production and less money means less units. Units which already aren't cost efficient, leading to an even weaker position than an investment in tech normally risks. That means people play more passively or cheese, which leads to less interesting games. Going for production structures is a fool's errand because even if you have as many units as your opponent, your army won't trade effectively anyway since you don't have the tech to delete portions your opponent's army (or play tactically pre-LotV).\n\n\n\nVery difficult to come back from even a single mis-step or mistake\n\nvery little \"extra\" money, difficult to replace what's lost. Usually have to skimp on base defenses which makes drops and harassment more effective.\n\n\n\nAll of this stems from the simple fact that that the Zealot, Sentry, Adept, Archon, Phoenix, and Immortal do substantially less than their requisite costs would imply. I want to emphasize that again. Substantially less. Honorable mentions go out to the photon cannon, voidray, and observer for being somewhat weak and contributing to the above. Below are some of the compiled cost-efficiency numbers I wrote down a while back, categorized by DPS-, supply-, and health- per-cost and per-size. Per-cost is a decent metric for midgame, where money is your main limiting factor. Per-size is a decent metric for larger army sizes where cost is less important compared to terrain and damage density. Keep in mind that other factors also matter, such as production-structure efficiency (e.g. reactors make marines more efficient to build, observers take highly contested robo-facility time making their efficiency worse than it would initially seem), movement speed, utility, range, upgrade scaling, etc.\nThe data is restricted to \"core army units\", who focus on providing \"meat\" - solid HP and damage to fill out your army. These need to be supported by utility units (e.g. medivacs, lurkers, etc.) and higher tier damage dealers to thrive in the mid and late game. They should be all-arounders with quirks that lead to interesting dynamics during fights (e.g. marine stutter step, FF's exploiting roach range, banelings punishing clumping while zerglings punish spreading, etc.)\n\n\nEfficiency Charts\n\nCost is just a simple sum of minerals + gas. Technically gas \"worth more\", but it's also used in smaller quantities, mined in different amounts, different builds prioritize different ratios of mining, etc. etc. etc. Suffice it to say the ratios cancel out for it to be close enough to 1:1, and even if it didn't, builds would compensate to make them equivalent.\nAlso worth noting that these calculations were done with float point arithmetic, whereas starcraft 2 uses a 32 bit Fixed Point numbers. If you don't know what that means, essentially the numbers might be a tiny bit off compared to the game (or compared to what you might calculate, depending on your order of operations), but they're close enough that it'll make no difference.\nDPS#\n\nNo Upgrades#\n\nUnitDPS/CostDPS+bonus/CostDPS/SupplyDPS+bonus/Supply\nZealot0.1860-9.3023-\nStalker0.05540.07684.85076.7164\nAdept0.04970.10933.10566.8323\nMarine0.1967-9.8361-\nMarauder0.07480.14954.67299.3458\nZergling0.4024-20.120-\nRoach0.1119-5.5944-\nQueen0.0751-5.6338-\n\nSorted:\nBaseDPS/CostDPS+bonus/CostBaseDPS/SupplyDPS+bonus/Supply\n\n\nMidgame Upgrades#\n\n(charge, glaives, stim, blueflame, speed)\nUnitDPS/CostDPS+bonus/CostDPS/SupplyDPS+bonus/Supply\nZealot0.1860-9.3023-\nStalker0.05540.07684.85076.7164\nAdept0.04970.10933.10566.8323\nArchon*0.05000.07005.00007.0000\nImmortal0.05130.12824.807712.019\nMarine0.2948-14.742-\nMarauder0.11270.22547.042314.085\nHellbat*0.12590.20986.293710.490\nZergling0.4024-20.121-\nRoach0.1119-5.5944-\nRavager**0.0702-4.6784-\nHydralisk0.1356-10.170-\nQueen0.0751-5.6338-\n\n* Slightly misleading due to AoE\n** Slightly misleading due to biles\n\nBaseDPS/CostDPS+bonus/CostBaseDPS/SupplyDPS+bonus/Supply\n\n\nMidgame by size#\n\nUnitDPS/SizeDPS+bonus/Size\nZealot37.209337.2093\nStalker15.522421.4925\nAdept12.422427.3292\nArchon20.000028.0000\nImmortal30.769276.9231\nMarine39.312039.3120\nMarauder25.039150.0782\nHellbat20.139933.5664\nZergling26.827626.8276\nRoach17.902117.9021\nRavager18.713518.7135\nHydralisk32.542432.5424\nQueen12.877312.8773\n\nSorted:\nBaseDPS/SizeDPS+bonus/Size\n\n\nHealth#\n\n\n\nAssumes all upgrades listed in DPS Midgame\n\n\nHealth is simply health + shields\n\n\nI factor in armor as a bonus 10% hp.

That means that in addition to removing disruptors and redistributing their power, you'd also likely need to add a bit of extra sauce on top to make things truly even. I'm not saying it's easy, the number fiddling for such a large scope is incredibly intensive. It requires lots of careful consideration, lots of testing to cover for your inevitably flawed considerations, and even more tweaking after the most egregious oversights have been fixed and mature strategies begin to emerge. But the path is straight forward: if you want a less gimmicky, less annoying, less fickle-to-balance Protoss in the long run, you need to make their core army function like a core army. It needs to be cost efficient.\nI could go on at length about why this situation has gotten as bad as it has - a lack of clear direction for the race's design, community complaints, misunderstandings of core mechanics, etc. I could also go on at length about the various \"tools\" in the balance-design toolkit that can be used to change some aspects without affecting others, but that's all for another time. Instead, I'll leave you with the rough draft of the patch notes I wrote. It's split into 3 sections: The design philosophy, some changes to core system mechanics, and then changes to each unit. The only restrictions I set on the changes were that these changes must be reasonable to implement by the Balance Council - no brand new abilities or assets. I also wanted to try to change at least 1 thing per unit. Keep in mind, this was written before patch 5.0.11, which was the first major Balance Council patch afaik. I'm not 100% pleased with it, but I think it's interesting enough to drop in here at least.\n\n\nDesign Philosophy\n\nCore Design Principles#\n\nThe major feeling I've gotten from both Blizzard and the balance council is that there isn't a clear direction that they want to take Protoss in. There's a lot of fumbling, throwing shit at walls, and solving symptoms without solving core issues. The goal of this redesign is as follows:\n\nDefine an archetype that Protoss should fill\nMake changes that take Protoss in that direction\n\nIt's not so complicated when you put it like that. Ideally my changes would be accompanied by similar, but less heavy-handed changes to Zerg and Terran.\n\nThings instantly exploding is not fun for anyone\nLategame mass air is not fun for anyone if it's not rare\nBoth players playing out on the map is more fun and interesting than if one or both players stay at home\n\nThe safer your base is, the more willing you are to play on the map\n\n\nThere needs to be a good mix of simple units, \"complex\" units, and units with actives\nThere should be several viable compositions and strategies at every phase of the game\nSimple, elegant solutions tend to have better gamefeel than complicated solutions even if they both accomplish the same thing\n\"Micro\" as people think of it mostly has to do with a unit's base stats, and has very little to do with its abilities\n\"A core army of effective, but somewhat expendable units supported by a small number of higher tier, niche units that cover some deficiency of the core army \" is always a safe pattern to fall back on\n\n\n\n\nCore Mechanics Changes\n\nGlobal#\n\n\nAll starting worker counts reduced from 12 -&gt; 10\n\n\nAllow for more dynamic earlygame with a longer t1 phase before t1.5\n\n\nMain and Natural bases have full mineral saturation on all 8 patches\n\n\nMain mines out a little too quickly, forcing a 3rd base earlier than feels natural.\n\n\nAll workers now have a proper moving shot\n\nMicro is cool\n\nMassive air units can no longer stack ontop of eachother\n\n\nMass air is lame and ignores too many core RTS mechanics\n\n\nProtoss#\n\nPower Fields#\n\n\nSlow/Fast warp-in zones completely removed. Warp-in time is always a flat X seconds.\n\n\nartifact from when we thought reinforce time was more important than it is. This sort of added complexity is a little gross and has far-reaching consequences that still require dumb workarounds to this day.\n\n\nNexus now has an innate powerfield (only active after construction finishes). Powerfield can just barely fit a single 3x3 structure directly adjacent to the nexus\n\n\nprobably not 100% necessary, but could increase build variety\n\nShields#\n\nThe main goal here is twofold:\n\n\nIt opens up an additional tool for tweaking specific unit properities by allowing one to shift it from one shield type to another\n\n\nIt makes protoss units tankier and encourages shield upgrades due to a neat quirk of the damage calculation. When damage spills from shields to hull, the damage that is dealt to shields is reduced by shield armor. When the overflow is applied to the hull, it's reduced again by the hull's armor. Since most protoss units come with 1 hull armor, getting the extra shield armor might be the better call, especially when\n\n\n\nShields are now split into 3 categories: Personal, Purifier, Building\n\nPersonal shields have no shield recharge cooldown, restore 1/s\nPurifier shields function the same as current shields, 7s recharge delay, restore 2/s\nBuilding shields have a minimum of 1 armor a 14s recharge delay, and restore 3/s. Buildings do not restore shields when unpowered (but do not lose current shields either).\n\n\n\nPersonalPurifier\nProbeStalker\nZealotImmortal\nAdeptColossus\nSentryDisruptor\nHigh TemplarVoidray\nDark TemplarOracle\nPhoenixTempest\nObserverCarrier\nInterceptorMothership\n\n* Archon: see unit rework notes\nNexus#\n\n\nRecall and battery overcharge removed.\n\nChronoboosting a canon will increase its fire-rate\nChronoboosting a shield battery will increase its energy regen rate\n\n\n\nPhoton Cannon#\n\n\nAttack is now split between ground and air\n\nidentical stats but will auto-prioritize air units similar to the thor and queen\n\n\n\nShield Battery#\n\n\nStarting energy 100 -&gt; 50\nMaximum energy 100 -&gt; 200\n\nMaximum potential heal is 600 shields, up from 300\n\n\nCost 100 minerals -&gt; 75 minerals\n\n\n\n\nProtoss Unit Changes\n\nDisruptor#\n\n\n(ಠ_ಠ)\n\n\nI unfortunately have to get this out of the way right away, as it flavors the entire rest of the changes. This change alone highlights how dire of a situation protoss is in, and how much it's been covered up. Here is a brief description of the unit: It exists to instantly delete a significant portion of your opponent's army because nothing else you can build can trade cost efficiently.\n\n\nHere it is again for dramatic effect, because that is fucked. This unit DELETES portions of your opponent's army, because all your other units are so cost-inefficient. The correlary here is that it has to accomplish this, otherwise you lose badly. If you get the money shot the game instantly ends in your favor, if you get several OK shots it's even, and if you whiff you get stomped. I've seen it happen in so many GSL games it's not even funny. It's so swingy, so unpredictable, both sides are forced to just cope with this dumpster fire and just hope that things go their way.\n\n\nI'm sorry to anyone who like this unit, but it is terrible, it has made the game significantly worse, and it isn't salvageable. Best to rip off the bandaid and see where else we can redistribute this power to.\n\n\nRemoved, stomped on, and thrown through a shredder into an incinerator\n\nZealot#\n\n\nZealots are by far the weakest t1 unit. Despite what some would have you believe, they aren't very good in the mid and lategame either (see Unit Efficiency Charts). While they have some utility in the midgame and lategame - particularly due to their cost and building damage - they are still outclassed in damage, tanking, and utility by their contemporaries. They also critically lack basic earlygame usability, and are hard to use tactically due to charge being a 1-way trip. These changes aim to put zealots on even footing in the ultra-early game, and to help them come online a bit quicker and cheaper in the midgame.\n\n\nBase movespeed 3.15 -&gt; 3.5 (charge values unchanged)\nCharge cost reduced 200/200 -&gt; 100/100 AND/OR charge impact damage re-added\nShields increased 50 -&gt; 60\nWeapon upgrades increased +1 -&gt; +1.5 (zealot attack is 8x2, so this change is 9x2 -&gt; 9.5x2)\n\nAdept#\n\n\nWhen LotV came out, I was incredibly excited to see protoss getting a new core army unit. For those that weren't there or don't remember, it was originally incredibly tanky and had an additional upgrade for a bonus 50 shields. It also had a glaive bounce similar to mutas (though only 1 bounce, and only when an attack killed). A new core army unit was exactly what protoss needed to fill in the early game and add a bit of meat to the army so that it would be less reliant on splash damage and gimmicks. Unfortunately, most of that magic was removed in favor of what we have now. These changes aim to make the adept a much more viable alternative to stalkers (and complement to the army as a whole) without ruining the somewhat interesting properties they've acquired. An additional benefit is giving protoss a slightly more robust pivot against muta switches in PvZ and mass phoenix in PvP.\n\n\nHealth/shields increased from 70/70 -&gt; 75/75\nResonating glaives moved to cybernetics core\nNew upgrade on the twilight council, 200/200\n\nGlaives now bounce once for 33% damage\n\nNon-Light: 3.33 damage bounce, total dps 12.012 (compared to 9 without bounce)\nLight: 7.33 damage bounce, dps of 26.426 (compared to 19.81 without bounce)\n\n\nallows adepts to hit air units\n\n\nWeapon upgrades rescaled +1(+1 vs light) -&gt; +2\n\nSentry#\n\n\nThe sentry kinda got bodied in LotV. It has very little utility for its cost, and even the utility it has is pidgeonholed. Hallucination may as well be named \"spawn scouting phoenix\" ever since it was made a base ability. I'd like to make it more appealing to summon other types of units, either as damage sponges or as misdirections\n\n\nHealth/shields rescaled from 40/40 -&gt; 20/60\nRavager biles no longer break forcefields\n\nQueens are now massive units\n\n\nPsionic transfer can no longer pass through forcefields\nForcefield duration reduced from 11s -&gt; 8s\nGuardian shield radius 4.5 -&gt; 5.0\nGuardian shield gives a flat +2 armor rather than decreasing ranged damage by 2.\nHallucination summoned unit counts increased. Effective summoned HP differences in parentheses\n\nProbes: 4 -&gt; 8\nZealots: 2 -&gt; 6 (150 -&gt; 480)\nAdepts: 2 -&gt; 5 (140 -&gt; 375)\nStalkers: 2 -&gt; 4 (180 -&gt; 360)\nImmortals: 1 -&gt; 2 (150 + barrier -&gt; 300)\nArchons: 1 -&gt; 3 (180 -&gt; 540)\nVoidrays: 1 -&gt; 2 (125 -&gt; 250)\n\n\n\nStalker#\n\n\nStalkers are probably the only unit that I think are in a pretty much perfect position right where they are. Blink is an incredible ability, and putting it on any unit would instantly make that unit S tier. The stalker's stats are mediocre, but with blink that's fine. As a result, they won't see much change aside from a minor increase to their scalability\n\n\nWeapon upgrades rescaled from +1(+1 vs armored) -&gt; +2\n\nImmortal#\n\n\nImmortals are in a similar position to sentries. The changes against them were so heavyhanded that it left protoss in a dire position without many other options. These changes are mostly meant to revert the nerfs, while not overcentralizing around immortals quite as much as before.\n\n\nCost reduced to 250/100\nBarrier removed\nHardened Shields added and reworked\n\nAny damage inflicted to shields that is greater than 10 is reduced to 10 OR reduced by 50%, whichever is larger.\n\n\n\nColossus#\n\n\nIunno, it's probably fine. I wouldn't want to make it any more powerful than this though. If any more efficiency or damage is needed in the protoss army, it needs to be put on the adept, archon, voidray, or zealot first so we don't end up right back in WoL deathball territory.\n\n\nDamage rescaled from 10(+5 vs light) -&gt; 12\n\nObserver#\n\n\nSlightly more elegant solution than other suggestions I've heard. Makes proxying vs retaining a stargate much more of a choice, and relieves some of the pressure from robo production time.\n\n\nCan now be built from both the robotics facility and the stargate\n\nWarp Prism#\n\n\nAnother change meant to make people's bases a bit safer. Lategame warpins were a bit much, and this should help to keep them from being too egregious.\n\n\nPower field radius severely reduced (4-6 unit warp-ins max)\n\nPhoenix#\n\n\nPhoenix are going to have some big shoes to fill (as you'll see), thus they need some usability improvements. Their attack range was increased all the way back in heart of the swarm, but graviton beam range wasn't increased to compensate. This should make phoenix a bit more viable for harass and for picking off key targets, as you won't have to get quite as close.\n\n\nGraviton beam range increased 4 -&gt; 5\nAnion pulse crystals\n\nmoved to the cybernetics core, requires either fleet beacon or robotics bay\nAlso increases the range of graviton beam 5 -&gt; 7\nCost increased to 200/200\n\n\n\nOracle#\n\n\nRemember the dreams of the worker-friendly harass unit? Me too. Good times. This was one of the hardest units to make a call on, since I'm trying to work within the confines of what's realistically able to be put in the game at the moment. That takes a lot of new ability ideas off the table. A tiny recall could work, but there's so much potential for that to be fucked up that I couldn't justify it as anything other than a \"Maybe\". Pulsar beam had to go though, both to allow the phoenix space to shine, and to move towards the general direction of making everyone's bases a little bit safer. It leaves the oracle feeling a little empty, but hopefully the return of interesting stasis mechanics (and a DOOR FOR PROTOSS) will make up for that.\n\n\nHealth/shields rescaled from 100/60 -&gt; 60/100\nPulsar beam removed\nStasis ward autocast can be turned off\nStasis ward lifespan does not decrease while in a powerfield\nCost reduced to 100/100\n(Maybe) Recall ability added, functions similarly to the mothership core but with a very small radius (3-6 units max)\n\nVoidray#\n\n\nNot only was the usage of passive-prismatic more tactically interesting, but the addition of a button has done nothing to cause the unit to require more skill during an actual fight. In addition, they're a little frail. Sharing a range with stalkers means they're usually targetted with equal priority which isn't ideal, since having to move back to re-juggle priority works against prismatic alignment. This may not be as much of a problem with the buffs to the sentry, adept, and zealot (which all stand closer than voids), but oh well.\n\n\nPrismatic alignment reverted to WoL behavior\nAttack range 6 -&gt; 7\n\nTempest#\n\n\nThe tempest have always been such a weird unit. First it was meant to be anti-muta, then it was meant to be anti-zerg lategame, then we had fun for about 2 weeks, and then it was back to being anti-zerg lategame. I'm bringing the fun back. Disintegration (i.e. irradiate) is an incredibly fun to use ability, pairs well with the idea of a hit-and-run midgame, and provides unique gameplay styles over the robotics and twilight tech paths (i.e. taking out key targets to keep your opponent's army complexity low)\n\n\nTectonic destabilizers removed\nDisintegration re-added and reworked\n\n10 Range\nDeals 300 damage over 45 seconds\n70 second cooldown\n\n\n\nCarrier#\n\n\nCarriers are pretty gutted by change to massive air units, so I wanted to provide them with some extra utility. That utility comes in the form of tanking damage and repairing damage, which can be drag-and-dropped from the campaign\n\n\nCarriers now come with 2 drones that can repair friendly mechanical units\nInterceptor health/shields increased 40/40 -&gt; 50/50\n\nHigh Templar#\n\n\nTemplars are fine. The added auto attack was dumb, but I don't really mind that much either way. It's not super necessary now that many of protoss's pointless fiddly buttons are removed\n\n\nAuto attack removed\n\nDark Templar#\n\n\nWhy was this even added?\n\n\nAuto attack delay after blink removed\n\nArchon#\n\n\nArchons are surprisngly bad. On paper they're not, but in practice... Their splash radius is abysmally low, they take far too long to regen their shields, they're a t3 unit that gets bodied in cost efficiency by t2 units, they're bulky and reduce your army's surface area, and they cost two production cycles and 400 total resources to build. They also almost never benefit from defensive upgrades, making them laughably flimsy in the lategame despite their high HP total.\n\n\nThere are 2 options here because I'm indecisive, but I think both would accomplish a similar thing - making archons less of a sink-unit and more of something you actually want. For their cost, they should provide much more meat and stability to an army. They retain the unique \"making these from templar feels bad\" in the first option due to paying extra for the same unit.\n\nOption 1:\n\nCan be directly built/warped-in from the gateway for a cost of 125/150 and 3 supply (similar cost to siege tank/liberator/lurker)\n\nyes, merging 2 templar that cost 4 supply would result in a unit that costs 3 supply. Theoretically this could allow for a protoss \"extractor trick\", it's up in the air if that's okay or not.\n\n\nHas a unique shield type that does not have a recharge delay and recharges 2 shields per second\n\nOption 2:\n\n100% damage splash radius increasd from .25 -&gt; .5\n50% damage splash radius increased from .5 -&gt; .75\n25% damage splash radius increased from 1 -&gt; 1.5\nHas a unique shield type that does not have a recharge delay and recharges 3 shields per second\n\nMothership#\n\n\nIf it's gonna be a meme unit, at least let it be an extra silly one\n\n\nTech requirement is now a Cybernetics Core rather than Fleet Beacon\n(Maybe) Add in mothership core with different, less obnoxious abilities\n\n\n","id":"https://walnut356.github.io/posts/protoss-cost-efficiency/","title":"Protoss has always had a cost efficiency problem"},"https://walnut356.github.io/posts/simulating-starcraft-p1/":{"body":"A while back, I made a small application meant to demonstrate some important principles about RTS design, namely that unit stats in a vacuum can be very misleading. As a quick example, stalkers have ~9.7 dps on paper. When fighting marines though, their effective DPS drops to ~8.4 (8.2 with combat shields) due to overkill. That's about the same DPS as a sentry. Unfortunately, there's only so much info that can be extracted from a Time To Kill calculation between two units.\n\nEven when focusing only on small-scale interactions, one major flaw is that it doesn't reflect behavior between unit compositions and divisibility. For example, a stalker and an adept will 1-shot a zergling, but only if their projectiles collide with the zergling at the same time. Otherwise, the zergling regens a tiny bit of HP and lives on \"1\" hp. This gives them both ideal DPS with no overkill, but really awful dps if the projectiles are spaced out too far.\nI made some attempts at predicting fight behavior based on total health vs total DPS between two sets of units, but it never had great accuracy and I ended up setting it aside for quite a while. The recent RTS boom has reignited my interest though, so I want to take another crack at fight prediction.\nThis is a bit of a journey, so I'll be splitting this post (and the work) into several parts. For now, we're going to lay out a plan, set up the tracer-bullet, and do a small amount of testing for accuracy. The source code for this project will all be available here.\nWhy bother?#\n\nI have 2 major motivations for handling this programmatically:\n\nSpeed - I don't have all day to fiddle with unit testers and the editor, manipulating values and re-testing and rinsing and repeating. I want to run bulk tests, fiddle with values, and have a new answer within seconds.\nInstrumentation - There's a lot of info that's simply unavailable (or incredibly tedious to capture) when manually inspecting a fight - even with frame-by-frame analysis. For example, how much damage exactly did all of the zealots do in a maxed out fight? What percentage of the total damage of the entire army was it? You can more or less figure this out by inspecting a VOD, but it might be the single biggest waste of several hours that you could embark on. Trust me. By making my own simulation, I can easily track whatever details I want and inspect them after the fight. I can compare those numbers before and after, say, giving 1 army upgrades, and see how much it truly affects things. I can also do fun things, such as adding in a primitive AI that micros the simulated units.\n\nBoth of these motivations rely on me making changes to the units in the game. RTS balance and design is endlessly fascinating to me, but I think it falls under a similar umbrella as fighting games - the systems are finnicky and sensitive. Even the tiniest numbers change can have drastic ramifications in other parts of the game. I think the public tools for testing balance - assessing what needs to change, and how much of an impact it has - are weak enough to be genuinely harmful to balance design. It feels like current practice is pretty close to \"throw shit at a wall and see what sticks\". Even with a proper direction, the fine-tuning is a nightmare beyond just putting it in a ton of people's hands and hoping there's nothing busted lurking beneath the surface.\nA minor goal is to make the framework extensible to other RTS games (or simple enough to allow it to be rewritten for other games quickly). Custom units and modified stats should be incredibly easy to add and fiddle with.\nAs an example of how this sort of thing can be useful, during my initial exploratory work in the editor years ago, I made a neat discovery: picture 2 armies with identical total stats, but where one army is comprised of 10 units with identical stats and the other is comprised of 5 units whose stats are twice as high. The less numerous army will win every time, even when rigging the stats so overkill isn't an issue for either army. The reason is because a unit does 100% of its damage, regardless of its hp, until it dies, at which point it does 0% of its damage. This favors armies whose individual units take longer to die. I originally hypothesized that it would be very even, or go back and forth in successive runs due to the better natural target-firing with fewer total targets, but that didn't end up being enough to offset the frequent little hits to the overall damage output. The balance-design implication of this is that, when designing a race like zerg with more numerous units, their stats should be slightly higher than proportional to their increased unit count to have the same effectiveness.\nLittle tests and experiments like this can lead to all sorts of unexpected places. I think part of my motivation for doing this is to help expose just how many switches and knobs there are to fine-tune RTS balance.\nPrior lessons and considerations#\n\nThis section gets a bit into the weeds. If you're not a programmer or don't care about the ultra-specific details, feel free to skip it.\nThe TTK calculator was built in Godot via GDScript a few months after I first started learning to program. This lead to some pretty ugly code, but also some more subtle limitations due to the engine itself. GDScript and Godot in general aren't really great places for making non-entity data types. You can extend Object or go through the trouble of using GDExtension, both are kinda annoying but I digress. I intentionally chose to accept minor inaccuracies due to not mimicking Starcraft's data types exactly. Most values in the editor are of the Real data type, whereas Godot uses single and double precision floats.\nReal values are in a signed 32 bit fixed point format; the first 20 bits are interpreted as a signed integer, and the remaining 12 bits represent the fractional portion. This gives an integer range of -524,288 to 524,287 with a fractional resolution of 1/4096. Floats are more precise than this, so during successive calculations the extra accuracy can compound and give us divergent behavior than what's expected. How much of a divergence? Well, it's more pronounced in smaller numbers so lets use adrenal gland zerglings. Their attack speed in the editor is 0.696, divided by the adrenal glands modifier: 1.2, then divided by the Faster game speed modifier: 1.4. Here are the results:\n\nFloat64: 0.4142857142857143\nFixed32: 0.4140625\n\nThat's a difference of 0.05%. Unacceptable!\nIt's worth noting that we have to be a bit careful. For example, this code written as:\n\nresults in the value 0.4140625 (bit pattern 1696). If you instead write:\n\nthe answer you get is 0.414306640625 (bit pattern 1697). This sort of small divergence is what I want to avoid - numbers need to be converted to Real values before they're operated on.\nExcept there's one small problem, and this begins a list of concessions that my simulator has to make because I don't literally have the Starcraft 2 engine's source code. I don't know how the game speed is actually applied. Every source lists it as exactly 40% faster than \"Normal\", which is the speed that all the editor's values are relative to. 1.4 is not exactly representable with a Real value - the closest it can manage is the bit pattern 5734, or ~1.39990234375. Presumably the game clock uses the raw u64/u128 from the system clock, but is it translated to a float at any point? Single or double precision? Or is it directly translated to a Real? Is the 1.4x modifier applied as a float, or a Real? Essentially what I'm asking is, how divorced is the engine's clock from its own data types? Does the engine clock tick exactly 40% faster, or is this a f32/f64/Real 1.4x modifier on every duration and rate? To extend the previous example, the clock itself ticking faster would be written as:\n\nWhile that results in the same value in this instance, I'm absolutely certain the game values will present a case where it's different just to fuck with me. For my purposes, I'll be assuming that it's a Real, thus a 1.39990234375x modifier on all values. Using debug cheat codes, you can set the game speed to any value. Giving it an invalid value will not change the game speed. Setting the speed to 524287 (Real::MAX) results in some wild stuff, but attempting to set it to 524288 (Real::MAX + 1) doesn't change the speed. This suggests that it probably is a Real modifier, though it's not conclusive.\nHere are some other things to think about:\n\nI don't know if there is rounding, and if it is nearest/even/truncation\nI'm not 100% sure how starcraft 2's pathfinding algorithm works (though I'm vaguely familiar with pathfinding and RTS unit movement in general)\nZerg health regen has the editor value 0.2734 AND 0.273. The editor says these values are rounded to the nearest 1/256th (i.e. 0.273 is the correct value) but like... first of all, why? Second, why have an oddly specific value that's not rounded to the nearest 1/256th be the default value for health regen for all zerg units? Weird. (Edit: This is actually the other way around. 0.273 is the editor default, 0.2734 is the rounded value that's actually used. Still weird that they don't just set the default to the rounded value though).\nI don't know what RNG algorithm the engine uses. I'm just using the rand crate and hopefully that's good enough\nDoes random attack delay apply to \"secondary\" hits? The zealot's second swipe is triggered 0.28 seconds after the first swipe, but is that 0.28 guaranteed, or 0.28 ± random delay?\nI don't know the sub-physics-step ordering of events.\n\nTo clarify that last point, while updates happen in chunks to the observable gamestate, the engine is one continuous set of operations (more or less) - this is why in many fighting games when 2 players hit a button at the same time, p1 wins the exchange; their data was processed first. In this case, I don't know if healing or damage takes effect first, and when \"death\" is considered. Imagine a zergling whose hp at the start of tick X is exactly 1. On that tick it takes 1 damage. Does it die? If the regen applies first, the zergling's hp is raised to ~1.00122, it takes 1 damage, and then does not die because its hp is above 0 (in-game it would appear to still have exactly 1 hp). Conversely, if damage is applied first, the zergling's HP is reduced to 0, and then 1 of 2 things can happen. If the unit is marked as \"dead\", no further processing would occur for that unit, it would not receive regen, and would die. If it isn't marked for death until later, it might receive healing and thus be above 0 hp when checked for death.\nThis also applies to things like attacking and spellcasts - if their hp is reduced to 0 on the same tick that they would attack, does the attack come out? I think I could test for this using some hand-picked values in the editor, but I'm going to put it off for now since it should be a minor enough detail not to affect things much.\nInitial plan and implementation#\n\nThe structure is going to be relatively simple - all numeric operations will be done with the fixed crate's I20F12 type, which I've renamed to Real. Units will be generic bags of data, half will be the base stats, the other half dedicated to bookkeeping information. Before I go through several hours of tedious data entry for every single unit, I want a quick tracer bullet for the core system that we can flesh out more later. That means Stalkers, Marines, and Roaches as our only Units for the time being. They provide a nice mix of attributes (e.g. projectile vs hitscan, zerg regen, combat-focused upgrades, etc) that I can test almost everything. For now though, I don't want to think about position or pathfinding, nor some of the more finnicky details such as ability usage, micro, buffs, debuffs, or threat level.\nI ran into a small roadblock while adding unit data with Real values - I'd prefer as many values (and entire units) as possible to be const, since a major priority is speed. Anything we can do to get work done at compile-time instead of run-time is a big win. While many of the calculations will be evaluated at compile time, even when not declared as const, I want to guarantee that they are just in case. The easiest way to translate between a raw integer/float and a Real is to cast to a float, multiply by 4096.0, and then cast back to an integer. Unfortunately, while float operations are allowed in const declarations, they are not allowed in const fn for valid (but kind of dumb) reasons. I'd prefer the unit initializers to be const fn where possible so that's a bit of an issue. I tried a bunch of different options (lookup tables for the fractional portion, manually pre-calculating the value and using from_bits, implementing the conversions via integer operations, etc.) but they all obfuscated information or were unwieldy. They also had issues cleanly implementing the \"convert then operate\" semantics that I outlined before. Annoyingly, std::ops::* traits also aren't const fn and thus can't be called in const declarations or const fn even though they're mostly just delegated to integer operations.\nThat means we're reduced to macro nonsense. Hooray...\nI settled with 2: real!() and const_real!(). The former is literally just replaced with Real::from_num because it's ugly to call everywhere, the latter is a small abomination that \"overloads\" the arithmetic operators in the most common scenarios (e.g. a const Real that is a Real multiplied or divided by another Real) by internally replacing them with their const fn equivalents (e.g. const_real!(x * y) -&gt; ($x).saturating_mul(const_real!($y)). If const_real is passed a single parameter, it's converted using the const_soft_float crate (which I found while perusing the const fn float RFC) whose floating point arithmetic operations can be called in const fn. Ugh what a nightmare.\nAnyway, I can leverage some of the 1v1 invariants for units to help make things more static - for example, I don't know if there's an upper limit to the number of weapons you can give a unit, but the max you'll see in 1v1 is the thor, with 3. Abilities are capped at 32 per unit, but I can limit that to only a handful.\nWorth keeping in mind that we can modify the bookkeeping values to hold any data we might find useful - damage dealt, shots fired, distance traveled, damage blocked with armor, a list of every unit it targeted, etc. Most of this stuff doesn't require much memory to store and isn't very computationally complex. Just like in-game, the supply limit helps ensure that our armies never get so big that the computations take too long.\nThe Army struct will essentially just be a wrapper around a Vec&lt;Unit&gt;, and whose methods will provide the majority of the simulation. After working on this concept for a bit, I ran into some annoying lifetime issues as well as some edge cases that I hadn't considered. As a result, I decided to make the armies owned objects inside a Coordinator struct that would handle dispatching calls, the \"global\" RNG state, and other minor stuff. During fights, the main loop will consist of simulating a single tick: first movement for both armies, then healing, then damage. One army will calculate its values before the other, but the effect of that should be minimized via things like random attack delay and projectile travel speed. To keep the main loop (and reference juggling) simple, much of the functionality can just dispatch to individual Army functions. It returns an Outcome struct, which is essentially just a wrapper that can lazily evaluate statistics at the end of the fight.\n\nIt's important that we wait until all active projectiles expire before truly ending the fight, as this is how draw occur.\nI had to redesign the Weapon struct and attack functions several times to future-proof, as I'll eventually need to get around to things like multiple weapons and weapon priority. For now, targets are chosen randomly, and the first gun that can shoot the given target is the one that fires. Travel time is currently pretty primitive and just assumes units are always at their max range (not a horrible approximation considering default unit behavior). The hitscan/projectile split is easier to implement here, rather than having to retrofit it later. Once position values are fully taken into account, it should provide much better accuracy than the \"everything is hitscan\" approach that the TTK calculator used. It'll always have some minor inaccuracies because I don't think I have it in me to replicate all of the tiny phases of a single projectile that each have different speeds, accelerations, and various other factors that make the projectiles so visually appealing. Besides, I think in most cases the random attack delay accounts for a bigger variation in when a projectile hits than all the animation factors combined.\n\nPhoenix projectile animation phases\nSomewhere during the process of completing Advent of Code 2016 in C, I learned the value of handles. Rust really doesn't want you passing around mutable pointers to everything. The humble usize can act as a \"pointer\" though, so long as you never change the ordering of the Vec that contains the object you want. To my surprise, even ignoring the time saved from a happy borrow checker, this ends up saving me even more time and headache because I'm not allowed to sweep up \"dead\" units, which is actually desirable. We don't have to worry about holding onto \"garbage\" and wrecking the performance of our game because there is no game. Dead units do tell interesting tales, so keeping them around for post-fight analysis is something I'd likely have wanted to do anyway.\nI realized at some point that it might be better to put some of these bits of bookkeeping information in their own Vecs in Army struct rather than stored in the unit itself. Some values, like attack cooldown, are checked for every unit at once, so it should be a prime candidate for auto-vectorization and will reduce cache churn a bit as the Unit structs aren't exactly small. Using handles makes this much easier as well, since a unit's handle will be the same value as its bookkeeping handle. I'm honestly really pleased with this solution, it's been much more convenient than some of my initial ideas.\nThe most complicated portion of the simulation loop is the function where units decide whether or not they should fire their weapon. I can use a very similar state machine to one that might be used in an actual game engine, alongside some special processing for damage point. One minor point worth noting is that I'm using timestamps (i.e. \"what time will it be when I'm allowed to shoot again\") instead of timers (i.e. \"when this value hits 0 I can shoot again\"), as it reduces the amount of mutable state.\nThe first thing we have to do is check if the unit is currently attacking and, if so, if they've finished the wind-up (DmgPoint) of the attack\n\nNext we check if the unit can attack, if it has a target, and then grab references to the necessary objects. As a tiny aside, something I learned while working on slippi stats is that complicated state machines with lots of guard clauses are an exception to the \"let your code speak for itself\" rule. Summing up all the properties necessary to reach a specific spot in the code is a big help. It could be said that that's a sign to split the function into smaller functions, but I find that having to jump around to a million mini functions to see what each individual part does is more mental work than keeping it all in one place and just adding these small \"checkpoint\" comments.\n\nNext, the complicated bit. Some of the attacks in the game hit multiple times, like the zealot's swipes or the thor's AoE missiles. The consecutive hits are triggered some static amount of time after the first hit. Sometimes that static amount of time is 0 ticks. Luckily, there's only 4 major \"types\" of attack behavior: single hits, simultaneous 2 hits (e.g. phoenix), offset 2 hits (e.g. viking, zealot), and offset 4 hits (e.g. thor). We can put those in an enum and store the attack offsets inside them where necessary. This is one of those times where Rust's enums really shine.\nWe'll also need to track which part of the attack we're in. Super Smash Bros Melee handles this by just treating them each as unique states, so we can do the same\n\nA little messy, but it is what it is. Nested and conditional matches are always kinda ugly. Everything else is pretty straight forward - just iterating over units and modifying values in obvious ways.\nResults#\n\nSince the goal is to surpass the TTK calculator, I want to simulate more than just 1v1 unit fights. We can start small with 1 stalker vs 2-3 marines. Based on in-game behavior, the stalker should always win against 2 marines, and always lose against 3 marines. I'll be running the simulation 1000 times with a new random seed each time (which currently determines attack delay and targeting).\n\n\nPerfect! Now lets try a mirrored fight to see that if there's any sort of bias - let's say 10 roaches vs 10 roaches.\n\nI ran it several times and team 2 sometimes ended up with more wins than team 1, so it looks like we're in the clear. If it ever becomes an issue, I can add in some extra handling to remove the advantage - probably by making death not \"count\" until the end of the tick.\nHow about 10 stalkers vs 12 roaches? This fight is close enough to depend on targeting and pathing when the engagement happens. To mitigate this a bit, the editor runs are (somewhat unscientifically) executed by smooshing the 2 armies up against each other using move commands, then attack moving with both at the same time. The unit tester allows selecting both teams at once, so both receive the command at identical timings.\nI ran 20 fights in the unit tester and the roaches won 17 times, the stalkers only winning 2 times, with 1 draw (the final 2 units killing each other at the same time). Now the simulation:\n\nWow, that's remarkably close. I figured there would be more inaccuracy to be honest. When watching a fight, it's clear that due to the reduced range of the roaches, they're more likely to have to reposition after their target dies. Additionally, the random targeting in the simulation is very different from the proximity-based targeting in-game, which leads to \"waves\" of deaths. I'm not sure if I should be worried or happy that these factors aren't muddying the results quite yet.\nTake a look at how long the simulation took to run vs the amount of \"game time\" simulated. The simulation's in-game time was consistently a few seconds faster than the real runs, but that's not too important. For 1000 runs it took 49ms. To run the in-game test 1000 times it would take 21,000 seconds. That's over 5 and a half hours. So uh... that's a pretty decent time savings. I can probably squeeze out more performance with a bit of effort, but this is more than fine for a first pass.\nEven when bumping the unit counts to extreme values that couldn't exist in a 1v1 match, the processing time isn't too bad.\n\nNext Steps#\n\nAt this point, the core logic looks okay and the structs aren't likely to change too drastically, so it's probably worth doing the data entry for most of the remaining \"it moves and shoots\"-type ground units. The next thing I want to work on is probably position values, collisions, and pathing. That's a whole can of worms though, since I'm starting to veer into less familiar territory. It goes hand-in-hand with things like terrain, flying unit separation, and the \"wiggling\" that back-line units do when trying to get in range of their target. I might be able to put it off by working on abilities and buffs next, but there's lots of trouble lurking there too. Wish me luck.\n","id":"https://walnut356.github.io/posts/simulating-starcraft-p1/","title":"Simulating Starcraft Part 1 - Tracer Bullet"},"https://walnut356.github.io/posts/simulating-starcraft-p2/":{"body":"Oh how naive I was when I thought I'd be moving on to pathfinding and abilities. I had hoped some of the game's mechanics would function better in isolation, so I could gradually add complexity on top of the tracer bullet in a modular way. Unfortunately, that doesn't seem possible without a huge refactoring burden every time I add the next layer. It'll be more worth my time to properly architect it right now, and build it from the ground up with all of the systems it'll need.\n\nWith that in mind, the best way to figure out what my requirements are, fully, is to look directly into the game's data and see what its requirements are. Conveniently, I needed to do this anyway as I'd rather avoid the tedium of entering all of the unit data by hand.\nAs always, the code for this project is available here\nStarcraft's Database#\n\nWhen inspecting starcraft 2's installed files a while back, I noticed what looked like a proprietary database format and didn't look too much further into it.\n\nWhile reading Game Engine Architecture, xml databases were brought up and I had a House moment - I remembered the \"view xml\" button in the editor. Instead of having to manually enter unit data, I could make a quick parser for the xml. I'd been mulling over creating some sort of external json data store for the same purpose anyway, so this would be perfect. There's an \"export balance data\" button in the editor that dumps 1000 xml files, one for each unit and structure. Unfortunately, the data from this dump is far from complete. It'll make more sense in a moment, but it looks like this function just traverses the unitdata.xml, resolves the versioning and links, cleans up the xml structure, and outputs a file for each unit. This ends up hiding some of the nitty-gritty of the weapon functionality that I can't really ignore.\nInvestigating further, I stumbled across an old reddit thread that pointed me to this website which explains the proprietary database format that blizzard games use, and provides a GUI application called cascview to inspect the data. Using cascview, I was able to extract the liberty, swarm, void, and voidmulti .sc2mod/base.sc2data/gamedata folders, which contain xml formatted data for every... well, every thing in the game. More data than we need to be honest. It's still going to be a bit of work to make it usable though.\nThe game and editor seem to work based on a sort of \"versioning\" system. voidmulti does not contain all the data for all the current 1v1 units as one might hope. Instead, the base data is held in the expansion where it was first defined, and future files are applied \"on top\" of old files, replacing any relevant data fields. While I'm sure that makes some things very easy for the developers, it poses a slight annoyance for me, as I now more or less have to do the same. Additionally, there's quite a bit of \"unused\" data, even within the subset of 1v1 units. Many units still have various forms of alpha/beta attributes (e.g. adept shield upgrade, replicant unit data, mothership core, warhound, herc). Some things are also structured in such a way that makes it hard to parse without replicating the engine's struct layout - something I've been skirting the line of, as I can take many more shortcuts if I don't.\nI have a couple of options:\n\nParse the data into sructs, store the structs as raw binary data, and then mem::transmute them from the raw data at runtime\nParse the data into an intermediate format, generate Rust source files with the const declarations in them, and insert those files into the crate before compiling\n\nI wasn't super comfortable with source code generation prior to reading Crafting Interpreters, but they did it a lot for their jlox interpreter (since Java doesn't have macros) and it grew on me. I'd generated assembly and vm code before when working on nand2tetris from scratch in Rust, but for some reason it hadn't occurred to me to generate high-level source code. In any case, I'm not super fond of either idea. The second one sounds more like what I want, but also feels like it leaves the system less modular than the first. I've done binary formats before though, so I may as well get some more experience with codegen.\nParsing#\n\nParsing these \"loose\" data formats in Rust can feels a little painful sometimes, but xml felt notably worse than the json, amazon ion, and some other event-based systems I've worked with before. Stringly-typed is already rough, but xml feels a lot like completely unstructured data, so the parsing code ends up requiring a lot of nested loops and matches. I used roxmltree, which had great performance, but I almost would have liked something a bit more \"batteries included\" like serde_json where it just dumps everything into a big HashMap with pre-existing enum-types.\nStructure#\n\nThe xml documents are grouped by \"type\" (e.g. unitdata.xml, weapondata.xml, abildata.xml) and some of the nodes are just links to other data via string IDs:\n\nThis is... less than ideal. It's not so bad when one file links to another file like this, but it's hardly ever just one link. And those links lead to more links. Sometimes, they link right back to the file you were just in. Untangling this spaghetti by hand so I could understand it enough to write the parser was the first time I've ever understood the market for ultrawide monitors.\nIf you look up the WeaponArray link, PsiBlades, in the weapondata file, you're treated to this listing:\n\nOh, you wanted to know how much damage they deal? Sorry, that information is in another castle. Follow the Effect link into effectdata.xml.\n\nStill no damage. That's because this is the handling for Zealots attacking twice - the PeriodicEffectArray tells us the weapon effect that will apply, and the listings under it describe how many times, and at what intervals they occur. So we follow the PsiBlades link (thankfully in the same file) and finally we can see the rest of the weapon's stats:\n\nNeat...\nNot everything can be that bad though, right? How about marauder attacks? The WeaponLink is to PunisherGrenades:\n\nSo there's a DisplayEffect leading to PunisherGrenadesU and an Effect leading to PunisherGrenadesLM.\n\nCool, it looks like the DisplayEffect link just takes us directly to the damage values. But wait, what about the projectile? I need the speed and acceleration values for that. It looks like LM is short for \"Launch Missile\" (but don't think that these suffixes are used with any sort of consistency, that would be too easy). Following the PunisherGrenadesLM link takes us to this listing:\n\nThe ImpactEffect links to an object that applies the damage and, conditionally, the slow from concussive shells. The Movers links to the moverdata.xml file, which has our motion phases. But wait, back up. Why didn't the zealot's weapon data have a DisplayEffect? And for that matter, the Stalker's ParticleDisruptors don't have an Effect:\n\nUp til now, I've been using liberty.sc2mod, as it has most of the game's data, and no missing fields (or so I thought). After fiddling with cascview a bit more, I realized I was missing core.sc2mod, which has base class definitions for most of the structs. Whoops.\n\nAh. Those ##id## tags are, I think, used for \"creation wizards\" within the editor, and function like placeholders in format strings. We can confirm this by looking up the name of the Stalker's weapon in effectdata.xml.\n\nOkay... but where's the Mover? Maybe it's from the base class of CEffectLaunchMissile?\n\nUh... huh. So Movers aren't a default part of this struct, they were explicitly added to the marauder's missile. So how does the stalker's missile know how to move? I guess we can look up the AmmoUnit? I'm not sure exactly what that is, but it's the only thing that seems like it might have a mover. It's got \"unit\" in the name, so lets try unitdata.xml.\n\nStill no Mover. At least we have an all-caps parent attribute, so lets head back over to core.sc2mod and look up what MISSILE is.\n\nHey, there it is!\nNot everything is this bad, but everything is its own brand of pain. You want to know how much the damage increases per upgrade? Head on down to upgradedata.xml. Build time? That's tied to the buildings themselves, which are in unitdata.xml, but training units its treated as a spell, so you also need to have abildata.xml handy. You don't even want to know how awful the Colossus attack is. Expand this at your own risk:\n\nBeware, unspeakable horrors inside\n\n2 beams, 2 effects, pretty straight forward. Probably not much more complicated than the zealot's attacks\n\nOh. Oh no. It's not a rectangular collision check, it's 11 individual circular checks that happen really quickly one after another with eleven small positional offsets. Oh you think that's bad? The hellion attack has twenty four.\nAnd don't think the movement was the only thing that ended up duplicated\n\nAnd here's the actual damage numbers\n\nIck.\n\n\nDon't forget about the myriad of weird exceptions and non-standard names and unexpected interrelationships.\n\nLurkers aren't called Lurker, they're called \"LurkerMP\".\nThe siege tank doesn't have it's siege-mode gun in its WeaponArray, that's in an entirely separate unit called \"SiegeTankSieged\". Oh yeah, and LurkerMP doesn't have a weapon, only \"LurkerMPBurrowed\", because every zerg ground unit has an entirly separate \"Burrowed\" counterpart.\nThe thor is split between 2 entities, one for each AA mode, but that means both contain identical copies of the anti-ground weapon.\nThere are parent classes DU_WEAP, DU_WEAP_MISSILE, and DU_WEAP_SPLASH. The latter 2 have DU_WEAP as a parent, but set the Kind value to Ranged and Splash respectively. Can that be used as a shorthand to determine if something is ranged/melee/splash? Haha. Nope. There are lots of exceptions, like the Viking's missiles that have a parent of DU_WEAP_SPLASH, but then manually set the Kind to Ranged, invalidating the only unique factor of its parent class.\nAs far as I can tell, there's no indication for hitscan vs projectile besides the absence of a Mover and/or CEffectLaunchMissile (which are both somewhat annoying to check for)\nIt's not always clear when something has been removed in a new patch.\n\nWrangling#\n\nThis process was kinda messy. I'm parsing 5 \"generations\" of 6 files, and each of those files frequently link to other objects in other files. I spent a long time trying to \"route\" the parser and cleanly get all the info I needed in 1 pass with carefully ordered stream-parsing and stored links for data that's needed later. In the end, I just shoved everything into hashmaps like serde_json, as it allows me to correct mistakes or add/remove data from the final output much more easily.\nHaving the documents and maps be 'static saves a bunch of headaches later. Normally, I'd use lazy_static for this sort of thing, but I tried out the static_init crate and was pleasantly surprised. It doesn't really function much differently for the user, but I find the attribute macro to be less noisy than the top-level function-like macro that lazy_static uses. I've heard static_init also initializes before fn main() is run rather than the first time the object is accessed, so that's neat. As always, the paste crate comes in handy for defining new identifiers inside macros:\n\nYou'll notice that I didn't include the core data at all. I found it easier to bake the core data into the parser's invariants since it's all \"abstract classes\" anyway.\n\nThe code isn't too complex; each file has a bespoke function that initializes each of its top-level nodes with appropriate defaults, and then lets a generic recursive function handle the child and nested-child nodes. Since everything is a string, there's not a huge need for the data-types enum that serde-json uses. Everything just gets shoved in this recursive Tag struct to be sorted later.\n\nThe Array type is worth talking about further. Arrays are sometimes nested within some sort of bespoke container (e.g. CardLayouts), but often aren't (e.g. WeaponArray). I had to add in a bit of special handling for arrays, since they're usually designated by repeated tags, which would end up overwriting each other. There's some added complexity because in subsequent patches, array contents are accessed by index, but we want to access them by the name of the object contained within. Since insertion order matters, I went with IndexMap rather than the trusty FxHashMap that I normally opt for. Every time I use hashmaps in Rust, I always default to .get(). I end up thinking to myself \"surely someone must have thought that hashmaps need an update_or_insert() so you don't always have to resort to match/if let\", and then I remember .entry() exists and does exactly what I want. If you haven't used that api before, definitely look into it.\nFirst things first, we have to handle those arrays. To make the structure more consistent, I'm artificially putting all array elements into their own containers. That means we need to\n\nDetect flat arrays and container arrays\nMake flat arrays into container arrays\nupdate or insert whatever data belongs at that location\n\nI've commented this code pretty heavily because there's a lot of possible execution paths and the hoops I have to jump through with Rust's conditional constructs don't map very cleanly to what the code means semantically. I'm sure there's a cleaner way to write this, but it is what it is.\n\nWhew, alright. A bit complicated, but it works. Luckily, the other two cases are very simple. If it's a flat node, we're only really required to update or insert the attributes. If it's not an array but it does have children, we can simply recurse using the entry's children map as our new base map.\n\nAll files are parsed fully up-front, and that makes routing a non-issue since I can access whatever I want without having to worry about storing links for later. The xml data has some tags used by the editor to help group specific objects, and I can piggyback off of that to filter the unit map for only the units and structures that can appear in 1v1 matches. By checking what units can actually be produced by each of the structures, I can filter it down even further to only those units that are a part of the current 1v1 ruleset. Parts of the list need to be hand-made to accommodate abilities that transform units into other units, but that's not too bad. Once I have a list of units, I can grab their weapon data links, traverse the spaghetti to figure out what \"kind\" of attack it is, if it has a mover, etc.\nAs verbose as Rust can be some times, it gives me a lot of peace of mind when wiring up this sort of thing. There's a lot of possible paths, but I'm not allowed to ignore any, so the program either instantly crashed upon an incorrect assumption, or worked perfectly. It took very little debugging to get the output I wanted, and that's not because I made no mistakes. I might have been able to hit the \"run\" button faster with Python, but I likely would lost more time than I gained by tracking down the silent failures that I assumed wouldn't occur.\nCodegen#\n\nIt's not difficult or complicated, since it's just some const struct definitions. It ends up as a bunch of format strings, with some conditional logic to handle things like how many weapons a unit has.\nAs I was writing it though, I realized that the old shape of my structs no longer really fit. Now that I have a clear picture of all of the factors involved, it's obvious that I need to make more sweeping architectural decisions right now, and that my prior plans were way too crude. Unfortunately, this means I can't quite finish the codegen, as I need to know how my structs need to look. To know how they need to look, I need to know how the data will be used. To know how the data will be used, I need to decide exactly what kind of \"simulation\" I'm going for, which will be the topic of the next post.\n","id":"https://walnut356.github.io/posts/simulating-starcraft-p2/","title":"Simulating Starcraft Part 2 - Data Wrangling"},"https://walnut356.github.io/posts/so-you-want-better-debug-info/":{"body":"Let me start with an emphatic \"me too\".\nI've put many of my side projects on hold because recent events have resulted in, what I consider to be, an unacceptable degredation of the debugging experience. It's a bit hard to focus on whatever I'm doing when I have to fight to figure out what's in a Vec. One of the great things about programming is that we're the ones who make our own tools; we don't have to just blindly accept mediocrity.\n\nDebug info seems sortof like water treatment or waste disposal: everyone relies on it, but it's not all that glamorous to maintain. It affects - and is affected by - so many disparate parts of the compiler. Changes considered safe elsewhere, like the name or ordering of private fields in standard library types, can break debug info. Updating your debugger can break debug info. The IDE extension that wraps your debugger can break debug info. It's a bit of a nightmare.\nThat being said, things are improving. By the time this is posted, nightly Rust will hopefully have drastically better debug info than stable - especially for *-msvc targets. I did a ton of digging, experimentation, and hair pulling to get things as good as they are, and most of that was via cryptic or incomplete documentation (if any existed at all). I want to talk a bit about how debug info works, the challenges involved, and the plan going forward. Hopefully, that can serve to lower the barrier of entry to working on it, or at the very least make it clear why things aren't (and won't be) 100% perfect.\nBefore I get into the meat of things, I just want to note that this is my first \"major\" open source contribution - both towards Rust, and overall. So first of all, wooooo let's go! It's been a bit nerve wracking, and if I accidentally merge-commit instead of rebase one more time I'm gonna curl up like an armadillo and implode, but it's been cool. I always said I wanted to work on dev tools, and here I am actually doing it.\nIn any case, to give an idea of the surface area debug info touches, here's a diagram:\n\nNow, I'm not an expert. Maybe this isn't so bad for someone who is. It was definitely daunting for me though. There's lots of rabbit holes, and I certainly haven't explored them all.\nDefinitions#\n\nDebug info#\n\nA set of lies that Rust tells LLVM - which is translated into an intermediate format - such that a piece of data in memory can have some or all of its meaningful info artificially reconstructed by a debugger while the program is running.\nI worded that very carefully. There's a lot of nuance contained there, and I'll try to clarify some of it here:\n\nThis whole stack is a game of telephone and LLVM is one middle-man among many. Some of them are in our control (i.e. open source/open to contributions), some are not.\nAs alluded to in the prior point, this can be a \"lossy\" process. It doesn't have to be, but at time of writing, it is. LLVM has a limited API with which to generate debug info nodes. Debuggers can and will ignore nodes.\nThe amount of \"lossy\" heavily depends on which middlemen you use. LLDB \"looks through\" type aliases of primitives (e.g. u8's will be reported as unsigned char). The PDB format loses generic argument information. GDB respects type aliases, but is hard coded to assume the type of all pointers and references to be *mut.\nDebug info generation is arbitrary. There is no requirement to represent types 1:1 with their in-memory representation. You can include more (or less) information, so long as there is enough that, combined with your language's invariants, the debugger can extract the info you want.\nA further caveat of the above is that you are not required to read a struct the same way that the program operates on it. This is vital for things like hashmaps, where it wouldn't make much sense to run the program's hashing algorithm on a key that you can't possibly know without inspecting the contents of the map in the first place.\n\nDWARF#\n\nA specification for a debug info format that is used for *-gnu targets. It is typically embedded directly in the compiled binary.\nPDB#\n\nA proprietary debug info format made by microsoft, used for *-msvc targets. It is contained in a separate file from the compiled binary. PDB itself is actually a container format which organizes a set of CodeView objects. Trying to find more information about PDB and especially CodeView can be really difficult. Microsoft's blog post links to a 404. Stackoverflow questions about those 404's lead to 404's. The wayback machine hadn't archived many of the links in the answers. I did find one that's still kicking though. I'd say \"save it while you can\", but this one has been archived, so we should be safe.\nCodeView is an absolutely ancient format that seemingly has not changed much since its inception. There's significantly less flexibility and expressiveness compared to DWARF. It was made purely for C and later adapted for C++, so there's 0 extensibility for non-C concepts. Not that it's fully featured for its intended languages either, but I digress.\nWhile PDB's specification isn't public, msdia140.dll has a documented API that can be used to read them. Microsoft also open-sourced a PDB reader written in C++, so it's not a complete black-box.\nBoth of the above formats contain information about types (name, size, alignment, qualifiers, etc.), function signatures, source code mappings (which line in which file does this instruction address correspond to?), scope contents, and more.\nDebuggers#\n\nThe programs that load your executable (and its debug info) and provide utilities like variable inspection and breakpoints. The 3 major players are GDB, LLDB, and CDB. Many developers use them wrapped in an IDE extension or other external program (native debug, codelldb, lldb-dap, WinDbg, etc.)\nDebugger Visualizers#\n\nA set of APIs that debuggers expose such that end-users can have some control over how their data is displayed. Typically they're written as plugins for the debugger, or as script files that the debugger can load in at run-time. They can be though of as \"prettifiers\", but they usually have enough extra power behind them to pull off some neat tricks as we'll see later.\nThe Rust Layer#\n\nDebug info is generated during the codegen phase using the AST of the source code and an FFI wrapper around LLVM's debug info API. If you've made a toy programming language before, nothing about the AST processing is particularly surprising.\nThis layer is the one we have the most control over for modifications and fixes. I emphasize \"control\", because this is not the layer that has the most power to actually effect fixes. Almost anything done on this layer is in service of, and constrained by, the limitations of another layer. Consequently, most of the fixes here are workarounds and lies to get things to work \"well enough\"; fixing things in the middle layers typically requires a lot more effort and some extra hoop jumping.\nIt's not uncommon to try a workaround for some debugger limitation and run straight into a brick wall of unreproducable, catostrophic errors, inconsistent handling of inline-initialized possibly-const static fields (jfc), or other such nonsense, and be thrown into territory far outside what you've been researching.\nTo be clear, that's not the end of the world It just means that the first-party ability to get the debug info perfect, quickly, is less powerful than one would expect. As an example, PDB not supporting generic args needs to be fixed by Microsoft. We can work around it via some gross string-based hacks, or by generating different, less \"true\" debug info, but the core issue still cannot be fixed on our end.\nDebugger visualizers technically also fall into \"Rust layer\" territory, but they're at the other end of the pipeline, so I'll talk about those later.\nLLVM and Raw Debug Info#\n\nThis is the layer I know the least about. I've done some exploratory inspection with the Rust PDB crate, as well as perusing the DWARF specification, but nothing super extensive. I don't really know how LLVM's API works internally, aside from the fact that there's SO MUCH INDIRECTION HOLY COW. Maybe I'd have had better luck using Visual Studio, but the VSCode extension I was using could not handle it. There's quite a bit of struct.DoThing() whose entire implementation is this-&gt;member.DoThing(), and that function's implementation is also this-&gt;member.DoThing(). Between that, everything being an opaque typedef'd pointer, random forward declarations and namespaces everywhere, and having to open both the header and the implementation of 700 different files, it's pretty maddening to navigate. Almost certainly a skill issue, but wow.\nOne thing worth noting is that LLVM has two different PDB handlers - \"native\", which appears to be written from scratch, and \"DIA\", which is a wrapper for the msdia140.dll COM pointer interface. One might work better than the other, but that can't be relied upon since Rust cannot guarantee which version anyone is using.\nI more or less just assume LLVM does &lt;the right thing&gt; and that any problems are inherent to the debug info specs, or can be solved elsewhere. Even if that isn't true, it's not a terrible assumption; these are probably the hardest layers of the stack to modify. Something like a revision of the DWARF standard would take years and adoption of the new standard is very slow. LLVM itself has a decently fast patch cycle, but it's a huge and complicated project, and their needs aren't perfectly aligned with our own.\nDebuggers#\n\nAs mentioned previously, the three most relevant are CDB, GDB, and LLDB. I'd love to see usage statistics for each of them, but judging by the Rust survey (70% Linux, 32% Windows, 62% VSCode, Rust analyzer for VSCode prefers CodeLLDB), most people probably use LLDB, so that's the one I'll talk the most about.\nThe most important thing to understand is that debuggers do not natively support Rust. Even though Rust generates debug info that the debugger can read, that's not quite enough. Debug info specs are pretty C-centric, and \"it's C\" is the default handling for unknown/unsupported languages in LLDB. To mitigate this, LLDB and GDB both offer facilities for language plugins to help bridge the gap between the debugger's internal representation of the debug info and the actual data in-memory at debug-time.\nAn easy example of why this matters is the debug info for references. CDB implicitly treats (and displays) all refs as pointers (&amp;u8 -&gt; unsigned char *, which is then sometimes interpreted as a c-string). LLDB and GDB respect reference nodes, but also display the type \"C-style\" (e.g. u8 &amp; as opposed to &amp;u8). That's not the end of the world, but what about a &amp;&amp;u8? &amp;&amp; in C-land means \"r-value reference\", which doesn't have an equivalent in Rust. When you inspect this value via the debugger, &amp;&amp;u8 effectively becomes &amp;u8. That means you'll be looking at the address of the first 8 bits of the address of a u8 value.\nAnd hey, what about the difference between &amp;mut and &amp;? DWARF has tags for both mutable and immutable types, but PDB seemingly doesn't. Even if it did, LLDB's API doesn't have a way to check for them. You can treat the const tag as meaning \"immutable\", but now GDB's Rust plugin will ignore that and unconditionally call it *mut. That's a simple fix on their end, but no matter what it'll be in a broken state somewhere in the interim.\nHopefully you're starting to see the issue: much of debug info's constraints are about the interplay between the limitations of the debug info format and the debuggers' API, all through C-tinted glasses. There are multiple formats and multiple APIs at multiple levels of completeness, resulting in a complex web of capabilities and limitations. It's not so bad when DWARF and PDB disagree because we can conditionally alter Rust's behavior at compile-time with a simple \"are we compiling for Windows?\" flag. But the compiler isn't (and cannot be, without a first-party debugger) debugger-aware. GDB and CDB handle mutually exclusive debug info (DWARF and PDB respectively), but LLDB can handle both. It gets very tricky when GDB or CDB disagrees with LLDB.\nTo narrow our focus a little, let's take a look at LLDB's plugin system. The basis of it is an inheritable, mostly virtual class called a TypeSystem. Rust currently piggybacks on TypeSystemClang - the default, somewhat C-oriented TypeSystem. To add language support, it \"just\" requires writing a TypeSystemRust. For additional capabilities, there's another set of classes that can be used to let LLDB understand the language's syntax and evaluate \"rust-like\" expressions in its REPL. Those are then compiled to a dynamically linked library for LLDB to load at runtime, which could decouple its upkeep from the LLVM patch cycle. Could.\nWe're getting into territory here that is well out of my depth. I mentioned before, but I'm not a professional developer (yet!). These sorts of bureaucratic and architectural decisions feel like they should be made by someone much wiser than I am. A working TypeSystemRust used to exist. It was canned in 2019 - so far as I've heard - due to a maintenance burden. It was then upkept by a third party as a dependency in a popular debugger plugin for VSCode. That third party then canned it in mid 2024 due to a maintenance burden. After monkeying with bandaid fixes in several other layers of this stack, I (tentatively) think that the best path forward is to resume maintenance of TypeSystemRust. Or, more than likely, completely re-write it as the API has changed substantially since the last Rust-official version.\nThere are 3 major questions that need to be answered though.\nWhose Repo?#\n\nThere are hints that LLVM expects a Rust plugin at some point. At the same time, they also make it very clear that the plugin system exists such that languages can create and maintain their own, irrespective of LLVM's patch cycle.To put on my semantics hat again, which does this mean?\n\n\"We expect there to be a Rust plugin eventually, but your lang support goes in your repos - these aren't our problem\"\n\"If you want it in your repo for more control, go for it. It's not required to be part of LLVM's to work\"\n\nMaybe I'm being optimistic, but a major benefit would be that we'd have some help from the LLDB crew for things like breaking API changes. Rust already has a pipeline for upstreaming patches to LLVM, so it wouldn't be a complete logistical nightmare. On the other hand, the plugin model is really convenient for the patch cycle and distribution methods Rust currently has. As we'll see later, debugger helper files are already distributed in every Rust toolchain.\nWhich language?#\n\nLLVM is written in C++. It occurs to me that the lack of support for the plugin we used to have may have been due to a shortage of people willing to work primarily in C++. Keeping the plugin in the Rust repo means there's no real red-tape preventing us from FFI-wrapping LLDB and writing TypeSystemRust in pure Rust. It wouldn't be the first instance of that sort of thing in the compiler. The initial workload would be pretty big though, since existing LLDB wrappers are very outdated and/or don't build properly on Windows. Funnily enough, that likely has the same root cause: a lack of people and interest.\nSomeone more versed in generating and hooking up these wrappers would have a better idea of the upfront cost than I do. Maybe it's prohibitive, maybe it's not. I've given it a few looks before, but I always end up putting it off because it's really hard to be motivated to diagnose linker errors. For a while that was how fixing debug info in general felt to me though, so maybe some day a switch will flick over in my brain (read: something will annoy me enough) and I'll have a workable crate before the heat death of the universe.\nHow much?#\n\nOnce again, I've been over-simplifying things. It seems like all that's needed is a TypeSystem, but that's not quite true. If I'm understanding things correctly, there's actually 5ish modules that are important for a \"perfect\" experience, and a TypeSystem might not even be 100% necessary to get a better experience than we have right now.\nLLDB documentation is pretty coy about what a TypeSystem even does. From a quick once-over, it looks like way to recognize and organize types based on the underlying debug info. It can store context and inspect type names to categorize things in a way that LLDB likes. It also looks like it's the layer \"underneath\" the python API. There's kindof a lot there though, so I'm not fully confident in that answer. Supporting the TypeSystem is a DWARFASTParser which is exactly what the name implies - it reads the DWARF info and provides that information to TypeSystems in a uniform format. It seems like a fair number of our issues with misinterpreted or ignored DWARF tags could be fixed there. Additionally, there's an ExpressionParser which is a little interpreter for Rust-like code so LLDB's REPL can evaluate expressions. I say \"little\", but interpreters are always a decent amount of code.\nThen, we have the Language and LanguageRuntime. The former appears to be the C++ equivalent of the python debugger visualizer API, with the obvious advantages of speed, and access to LLDB's internals. LanguageRuntime looks like it's meant to handle Exceptions and dynamic types (I think &amp;dyn qualifies?).\nSo which of those do we actually write? It's complicated. Judging by the C++ Language plugin, those can be standalone and do not require a bespoke TypeSystem. There would likely be some tangible benefits to using a Rust Language plugin over the python scripts we're currently using, but it's a hard sell when considering the contribution barrier is now C++ instead of python. Compiling LLDB to test it isn't a trivial task either, whereas python scripts can be loaded and reloaded at debug-time.\nIf we do make a TypeSystemRust, there won't be much benefit over TypeSystemClang unless we also make a DWARFASTParserRust. There might be some small benefits even if we don't, but the real fix is just not restricting the shape of the debug info we can generate in the first place, and that requires a DWARFASTParser. It's also not 100% clear to me how non-DWARF debug info is handled. I think the PDB is \"translated\" to DWARF, which is then passed to the DWARFASTParser? At time of writing, that's still on my list of things to look into.\nIdeally, we'd just make all of the plugins, but that's quite a bit of surface area and they aren't trivial to throw together.\nWe may have already veered into wishlist territory, but I'll definitely put us there by saying I'd love if Rust just had its own debugger. That opens the door for things like custom debug info formats, a first party VSCode plugin, the compiler and debugger working hand-in-hand, etc. It's obviously a huge undertaking, but not outside the realm of possibility considering things like RADDebugger, which has its own debug info format, or languages like Python that maintain their own debugger. Writing a basic program that loads other programs, steps through them, and inspects variables isn't actually all that difficult. The annoying parts come with all of the advanced features that LLDB has. Some of those, like expression parsing, are \"already done\" between miri, rust-analyzer, and the compiler itself. We'd \"just\" need to hook them up to eachother in some way. Others like remote debugging or exotic target support are more taxing, but aren't 100% necessary in the short/medium term.\nDebugger Visualizers#\n\nThere are two \"layers\" to this layer. On one hand, there's the rarely-used debugger visualizer API for Rust library authors, which I'll be covering in more depth in my next post, where I walk through creating visualizers for the TwoVec crate. For today, the more relevant scripts are those distributed with Rust toolcahins. They come in two flavors: XML, and Python. In both cases, the purpose is to prettify the output from the debugger. This is done by partially exposing the debugger's internal representation of objects. There's usually a way to store extra state and context details, override the displayed fields and type name, and run user-defined functions on the underlying data.\nMicrosoft is once again the odd one out, using an XML schema called Natvis. XML really isn't the greatest format for this sort of thing, but it works well enough. There's support for expression evaluation, context-variable storage, and pseudo-functions. The major missing features are the ability to override the displayed type name, and the ability to create custom views of primitives.\nGDB And LLDB both offer a Providers python API. You register a type (or a way to identify the type, like a regex), and then values of that type are put in a class with a specific interface. That interface is what's used to populate the summary and fields for each value. For example, the raw debug info for a Vec contains the length and the internal pointer, but that's not very useful.\n\nA simple script can read the memory at the pointer's address and cast the interpretation of those bytes to the element type of the Vec, outputting them as pseudo-fields. Some additional work can clean up the type names and provide a pleasing summary:\n\nIf you're interested in how these work, reconstructing hashmaps and niche-optimized enums are both pretty cool.\nIn this way, debugger visualizers are the \"prestige\" at the end of the lie told by the compiler all the way back in the Rust layer.\nJust like the Rust layer, we have quite a lot of control here. We're still limited by the debugger API, but there's a lot of clever hacks and workarounds possible when both ends of the pipeline are in sync. And, well, sometimes those hacks are necessary in the short term. As mentiond in the prior section, changing the debugger itself is a much more intensive process. I used the word \"hacks\" intentionally though - they are ugly, complicated, fragile, and only function when things actually are in sync. Those hacks raise some (to me) moderate dilemmas.\nSay that you're fixing some type output and you run into a debugger constraint. The current output isn't wrong, but it's missing some key info. There's a solution, but it requires lying about the type such that the raw output of the debugger is incoherent at best and outright misleading at worst. But, when run through a script, that new debug info provides enough extra pieces that the debugger displays perfect information. Is that an acceptable solution? Remember, the scripts are, to some extent, opt-in. They need to be loaded by the debugger at run-time, either manually or through some kind of automation step. The scripts supports the 3 major debuggers, but what about other debuggers? Is lowering the quality of their experience worth it for the increase in quality for current popular debuggers? Does it matter how frequently/infrequently this type is viewed via debuggers?\nMaybe the answer is simple, but I can't shake the brain worm that says \"it doesn't have to be this way\". The best of both worlds is fixing the debugger so that Rust doesn't have to lie in the first place. The supported debuggers get perfect output, and unspported ones (or, ones whose scripts haven't been loaded) get a mediocre, but coherent experience.\nAnd while we're talking subjectivity, what even is \"perfect output\" in the first place? I think \"perfect for VSCode\" and \"perfect for CLI\" are different metrics. Not every debugger UI is one that's piped through VSCode. Who are we optimizing for? I have an inherent bias of *-msvc on VSCode with LLDB because that's what I use. Changes that benefit my workflow could easily ruin someone else's. I prefer to show the contents of a pointer rather than the pointer's address. I've been in situations situations where the other way around is preferable though. It's not so bad if you can display all of the information (even if it's through a nested menu), but that's not always possible on the visualizer-end.\nCurrently, Vec's summary is its length and you have to expand it to view its contents. CodeLLDB used to format vecs like the vec![] macro as I displayed above. It's maybe noisier, but it's very convenient for smaller vecs. The downside is that now it's much more annoying to view the length. We could add the length to the top of the list of child elements, but now the expression parser will see the length as the 0th child-element of the Vec, which can be unintuitive in some niche cases when inspecting via LLDB's REPL.\nWhat kind of error messages do we provide when something is in an invalid state? Can we always detect if something is in an invalid state? For example, sometimes an out-of-scope string's pointer isn't set to null and still displays partial contents even though it's no longer valid. I think this can be fixed, but it might require large changes to how debug info is generated back in the Rust layer. I have no idea how nested scopes are currently handled - maybe it's something we're not even touching and it'd be a big overhaul, maybe it's just one field on a debug info node that's populated with the wrong value.\nI'll stop myself, but these sort of things crop up a lot. It's highly subjective, you can't optimize for everyone, and they aren't easy topics to resolve in a code review or pull request.\nWrapping up#\n\nThere's still a few more pseudo-layers I could cover like testing, Rust AST generation, or the debug adapter protocol, and a lot more detail I could add, but this is already pretty long. Debug info is a complex topic with complex systems driving it. At time of writing, there just isn't enough interest to give it the upkeep it deserves. If you want to help out, feel free to drop by the Rust Zulip's t-compiler/wg-debugging channel.\nOn a more personal note, this brain-dump maybe came across as pessimistic, but I really have enjoyed this process. I've struggled a lot in my life with self-efficacy - the belief in one's own ability to achieve a goal. I think it's easy to fall into the trap that just because something hasn't been done so far, it means it can't be done. That someone smarter has tried and failed or that it was found to be a suboptimal solution. As it turns out, sometimes nobody had the time or nobody cared enough to follow through. You can just do a thing, and sometimes that makes a difference. I didn't have many opportunities for that growing up, and it's really gratifying to see my time and effort turn into something tangible and useful.\n","id":"https://walnut356.github.io/posts/so-you-want-better-debug-info/","title":"So you want better debug info?"},"https://walnut356.github.io/posts/space-time-complexity-tradeoff/":{"body":"I encountered a neat example recently while solving Advent of Code 2015, day 6. The problem can be boiled down to \"There is a 2D array of values. Given a range and instruction, apply the instruction to all values in that range. How many values are 'on' at the end?\". There are only 2 possible states for each value: on and off, and only 3 possible instructions: on, off, and toggle. I won't focus too much on parsing the input or the structure of the algorithm here, I just want to investigate the hot loop which applies the instruction to each value.\n\nCode is compiled using -Ctarget-cpu=native for a Ryzen 1600x running Windows.\nRepresentation#\n\nWhenever I see a max of 2 states, my brain jumps straight to bit manipulation - why store in 8 bits what can be stored in 1 bit? The types of low-power, memory constrained platforms and programs I've investigated have given me lots of exposure bit fields. While that's what I'm comfortable with, it's often much closer to the \"space\" end of the space-time tradeoff. For something on the speedier side, we can represent the values as 8-bit bools.\nWhile I could use an array of arrays, there's no real need to when working with uniform dimensions (1000x1000 in this case). The bool array can be represented as [bool; 1000 * 1000] and the bit array as [u8; 125 * 1000], saving 875kb. While that sounds like an insignificant amount, it's worth noting that my CPU has an L1 data cache size of 32kb and an L2 cache size of 512kb. The bitwise implementation could reside entirely in the L2 cache, whereas the bool array necessitates pulling some data from L3. L3 access can be somewhat expensive, so it could make a difference.\nSaving time#\n\nAs a quick spoiler, the correct answer for my input data is 377891. This blog post isn't really about solving the problem (nor the most optimal solution), but it's important to ensure that no matter what we change we're still getting the correct answer. Wrong code is still wrong no matter how fast it is.\nThat aside, after parsing the line into the instruction and a Coordinate struct representing the \"top left\" and \"bottom right\" corners of the affected area, we can construct a simple loop that traverses the range\n\nFor bools, the loop contents are very simple, just translate the 2D coordinate into a 1D array index. Also note that the nesting-order of the loop matters. Row-wise access is typically more performant due to locality. Simply reversing the order of the loop slows down execution time by about 30%.\n\nTo collect the values at the end, we can use an iter-fold:\n\nAnd hey, we get the correct answer in only ~18ms.\nSaving Space#\n\nBut what if we want to fiddle with bits? Well I've got 2 options in mind, and one is a bit spicy. The first is the simple bitwise operations we're used to, the only tricky part being that we need to index into both the array and the individual u8s at the same time. 2D -&gt; 1D array access is y * width + x. but since our array width is effectively 8x less, we need to divide both sides by 8. To get the offset into the u8, we need the remainder of x / 8. We can then bitshift by that offset and set/clear/complement to apply the operation:\n\nCollecting the values requires a slight modification of the iter-fold:\n\nThis runs a bit slower at ~28ms.\nSo how about a little spice? This was my original solution:\n\nI had just finished reading The Art of 64-bit Assembly, and the BT* instructions were fresh on my mind. For those that don't read ISAs in your free time, BTS, BTR, and BTC are very cool instructions. The mnemonics are short for \"Bit Test and &lt;Set / Reset / Complement&gt;\". You feed the instruction a memory address and a bit offset, and it sets it, clears it, or inverts it. It also sets the carry flag so you know what the bit was before you operated on it, and you can optionally make the instruction atomic.\nIt took me a few minutes to come up with - and convince myself of the correctness of - the indexing formula for the bitwise version. This version is the same level of cognitive complexity as the array of booleans, but with the space saving of the bitwise operations. Relative to other assembly instructions, I especially like how human-readable it is. I've spent a decent amount of time staring at PowerPC assembly, and the somewhat equivalent RLWIMI and RLWINM instructions require several paragraphs to explain, and are still kinda incomprehensible at a glance. RLWIMI has some cool differences, such as being able to operate on a range of bits all at once, but in most cases I see it used to modify a single bit.\nAll that aside, we can once again run it and see that we get the correct result, and a runtime of ... 47ms? Almost twice as slow as the bitwise version? That can't be right. Lets pull the work out of the loops into their own functions and check the disassembly to see what's actually going on. Running cargo-show-asm on the bitwise function reveals:\n\nAnd for the inline assembly function:\n\nIgnoring the function setup/teardown/panic, the inline assembly is significantly shorter - just 3 instructions, no branches vs the 11 and never-taken branch of the bitwise function. So why's it so much slower?\nI mentioned in the bool function that the nesting order of the loops was important for cache locality. What I didn't mention was that the equation changes when you're operating repeatedly on a single value, which the ASM and bitwise functions both frequently do. Modern CPUs are pipelined, meaning they're simultaneously executing several instructions at a time. A caveat of this is that any instruction that requires data from an instruction currently in the pipeline must wait until that instruction is completely finished before it can begin. This is called instruction latency. Stalling the pipeline like this can be disastrous for performance.\nWhen we reverse the loop ordering, the bitwise function runs in ~26ms, essentially no change at all. On the other hand, the ASM function now executes in 30ms, a massive speedup. This is likely due to the tighter overall loop - the previous value would have had time to clear the pipeline in the bitwise function due to the extra instructions and loop handling, but not in the ASM function. It's not too surprising that both methods are slower than the boolean version though; we have to do a bit of extra work with the values involved, and the reduced cache locality likely has a slight negative impact.\nThere's still a slight performance disparity between the two bitwise versions though and I'm honestly not 100% what it is. I investigated the instruction tables for my CPU, the AMD64 Architecture Programmer's Manual, and various forums. I'm not an expert at reading these sorts of sources by any means, but while the BT* instructions are definitely on the slower end, the numbers don't seem unreasonably bad. The general consensus seems to be that they're just slower than you'd expect when operating on memory.\nBut at what cost?#\n\nFor the final version, we can throw readability in the garbage. Neither the bitwise nor the ASM version are really the most optimal way to operate on this sort of dataset. We're operating on contiguous ranges, and because those ranges are usually pretty large, it makes more sense to do bulk operations rather than modify individual bits at a time. Doing so means we can maintain the cache locality of the bool version, the space savings of the bitwise version, and reduce the number of individual calls to memory greatly. To accomplish this, we can use u64's as a sort of \"poor man's SIMD vector\". Due to bad divisibility, we'll have to manage the fact that our \"rows\" won't end on even boundaries - for example, our first row of 1000 bits will end on the 39th bit of u64 #15. Luckily, 1,000,000 is divisible by 64, so we don't have to allocate any extra pad bytes. As an aside, an easier-to-reason-about method might be to have 16 rows of 1000, the extra space is simply ignored and doesn't affect the final total.\nI'll admit, this one took me several hours of debugging and a night's sleep to get working properly. I ended up needing to write several of my own test cases, wrestle with the language, and correct a few of my own assumptions. Did you know that overflow on left shift (e.g. u8::MAX &lt;&lt; 8) is undefined behavior C and is disallowed in Rust? I didn't, and apparently I'm not the only one.\nIn any case, I want to walk through this as it's a bit more involved than the previous examples.\nBecause we're operating on a range, we'll need start and end indexes. There isn't clean divisibility, so we need to delay the division as long as possible to avoid compounding truncation errors. Another difference is that we need to take the modulo of the full bit-index, not just the x value like before. This is because the rows don't always start and end on the same bit of their respective u64s (e.g. row 1 starts at bit 0, row 2 starts at bit 40).\n\nNext we set up the start bit mask by clearing the unnecessary bits via 2 bit shifts, and handle the case where the start and end index are identical. The second step isn't necessary if you structure things a bit differently, but this makes a bit more sense to my brain. Note that when handling the \"end\" index, we need to alter the bit shifts so that we clear off bits on the opposite side.\n\nWe then loop through the values between the start and end, replacing them with u64::MAX, 0, or xoring them with u64::MAX as required.\n\nAfter that, we handle the end index and we're all done!\n\nRunning this gives us the correct answer, in only 544.658µs - a speedup of ~30x over the boolean version using 1/8th the memory, and a ~45x speedup over the bitwise version. All it cost was several hours, a bit of hair pulling, and some extra comments in the source code.\nAt this point, I suspect that we're nearing the limit of how much faster we can make it. We could experiment with real SIMD registers and operate on even larger bit slices, but that's for some other time. If you want to see the full source code, it's available here.\nI think this problem is a really neat demonstration of the tradeoffs between memory usage, CPU time, and the readability of your code. It also provides a nice reminder that sometimes readability can come from unlikely places - in this case, a simple assembly instruction has (arguably) less cognitive complexity than the equivalent high-level bitwise indexing. While we often see examples of what great code looks like, and how we can still make great code that's performant, I always find it a fun exercise to throw all that to the wind and write some very fast, very gross code. One of my favorite experiences with programming has been learning how insanely fast computers really are, and just how far you can push the limited tool sets that programming languages provide.\n","id":"https://walnut356.github.io/posts/space-time-complexity-tradeoff/","title":"The space time complexity tradeoff"},"https://walnut356.github.io/posts/syntax-test/":{"body":"I write my own sublime-syntax files for the syntax highlighting on this site, this page is meant for testing edge cases.\nRust#\n\n\nLLVM#\n\n\n","id":"https://walnut356.github.io/posts/syntax-test/","title":"Syntax Test"},"https://walnut356.github.io/posts/twovec-a-very-silly-container/":{"body":"Lets say you want to store two different types of objects in 1 container.

That means even with #[repr(u8)], a Val::A(u8) is 64 bits in size, despite it being possible to represent all Vals with only 5 bytes, and all Val::A(u8)'s with only 1 byte + 1 bit. Val::B(f32) is less wasteful, as only ~48% of its bits are complete dead weight, but it's still a sad number.\nNot to worry, I know RAM is the most precious of commodities in 2024 so I've come up with the answer to your woes. The TwoVec:\n\n\nIn the above example, I made sure to exactly fill the current allocation size of list. That means the listed capacity (18 bytes) minus the size of the data is the amount of overhead for bookkeeping. 4 u8s and 3 f32s takes up 16 bytes total, so we only have a storage overhead of 2 bytes! Compared to the Val enum above, that's a savings of 30 bytes.\nThe source code is available here, and the crate is available on crates.io\nHow it works#\n\nThe basics are pretty simple, but getting it to work in Rust's type system was a bit of an adventure.\nTo get the basis of the container out of the way as quickly as possible: array indexing is nothing but a base pointer + an offset. Arrays themselves are nothing more than an arbitrary region of bytes, regardless of what type they're \"assigned\" (see: C's void*). Types are only \"real\" at compile time. Having arrays that contain only 1 type - or ensuring that all types contained in the array are the same size like enums do - allows for consistent and universal indexing math. That being said, if you can figure out the offsets on your own, there's nothing stopping you from implementing the indexing logic yourself. In a sense, hashmaps already work based on this principle.\nWe only have two states, easily represented by a single bit. We know the size of both of the types, so we should be able to calculate the byte-offset ourselves by counting the number of each type and multiplying it by its respective size. We can start with a struct very similar to a standard Vec:\n\nCrimes against debugability#\n\nYou might notice that there's only 1 capacity and 1 len, despite there being 2 pointers do data. Since RAM is at a premium, we clearly can't store our bookkeeping bits in a different region of memory. Just think of the wasted allocator metadata bytes. As the old saying goes: \"Only 1 allocation for this rustacean\". This increases the bookkeeping complexity by a bit, but at least we can now say we're storing three different types in a single allocation instead of just 2.\nThis has a substantially negative impact on the debugging experience, since now it's possible to overwrite bookkeeping data with element data and vice versa if we fuck up our indexing math. Which I definitely didn't do like 5 separate times. And when yo- ahem if you fuck up, have fun debugging bitfields and packed, probably unaligned values. Just awful. I definitely do not speak from experience though.\nJust for sake of example, imagine a few of the bits being set incorrectly due to an off-by-one error. Suddenly, your pretty-printer for the data block isn't just interpreting the bytes as the wrong value. The offset of the next value is partially based on the size of the one we have. If we interpret that size wrong, we're now jumping to the wrong location and even if we weren't, there's a good chance we're interpreting the bytes there as the wrong type too. The debugger display (at least, the one I was using) is largely unhelpful as well since an unsigned char* is interpreted as a C string. Hope you didn't have any \\0 bytes in your data anywhere or you only get to see fraction of the total block =)\nReading listings that looks like this\n\nand trying to extract useful information about why things went wrong is a special kind of pain. Again, not that I speak from experience or anything.\nAnyway, upon the first allocation of a data block, typical Vec implementations will reserve space for a handful of elements to reduce the number of times the Vec needs to be realloc'd. In our case, it's not so simple. If we reserve 8 spots for f32s + 1 additional byte for the bitfield, we run into a problem. If we filled the TwoVec with u8s, we wouldn't have enough bits to tag them all - 8 f32s takes the same space as 32 u8s. We always need to make sure we have enough bits to cover the worst-possible case:\n\nOn each reallocation, we double the number of elements that can be stored, which exactly doubles the number of degenerate-case slots. Thus we don't have to worry about further fiddling with the bitfield size after the initial allocation, doubling the whole capacity suffices.\nUnfortunately, that brings up another issue. We cannot simply call realloc. realloc automatically copies all of the old bytes into the new allocation. In TwoVec, the distance between the start of the bitfield and the start of the data block is not static, it grows when the allocation grows. That means we need to manually copy the data over in two steps, leaving an extra gap for the new bitfield bytes\n\nCrimes against the type system#\n\nThe get and push functions require 2 different implementations because we need to be able to detect if the type we're asking for matches the value of the type-bit. i.e. if we want a B, we have to check if the bit is 1, but if we want an A, we have to check if the bit is a 0. It might be possible to pull this off dynamically in 1 function, but we still have another issue.\nThose with a keen eye may have heard some alarm bells when I showed off the type inference of the get and push methods. After all, if they were defined as\n\nWe suddenly have a very big safety hole. Rust's type system can express exactly 2 relationships between types. TwoVec&lt;A, A&gt; is a TwoVec whose elements are always of type A. Conversely, TwoVec&lt;A, B&gt; means that elements may be of type A or type B, and that A might be the same as type B, but also might not. There is no way to indicate that two types must not be the same. There is also no way to guarantee that a third type (T in this case) is A or B.\nImagine we have a completely full TwoVec&lt;A, B&gt; and we access the last element with our get function. Except we forget what type A is, and call get with a type where size_of::&lt;T&gt;() &gt; size_of::&lt;A&gt;(). Since this whole house of cards functions via pointer casting, there is nothing stopping this from reading out-of-bounds memory. Even if we added a check (e.g. if ptr_to_elmt + size_of::&lt;T&gt;() &gt; ptr_to_end_of_alloc) we're still giving people an \"unsafe-free\" mem::transmute().\nWe could try declaring the function get&lt;A&gt; or get&lt;B&gt;, but now it only works for one of our two types which isn't ideal. Instead, we can try using a Get&lt;T&gt; trait to accomplish this.\nThere's a problem when we add the impls though:\n\nBecause A and B could be the same type, the compiler wouldn't know which impl to choose. We, as the programmer, know that it doesn't even make sense for a TwoVec to be used when A and B are the same type - TwoVec&lt;A, A&gt; is strictly worse than just using Vec&lt;A&gt; - but there's no way to express this via a trait on TwoVec.\nA bare marker trait on the types themselves also doesn't quite work.\n\nAside from the fact that the user must now define these marker traits, we also have the issue that there's no negative trait bounds (outside of the compiler) either! A type could easily implement MarkerA and MarkerB and it still wouldn't know which version to call. Even if we somehow bypassed that restriction and make the traits mutually exclusive, we cannot have TwoVec&lt;u8, f32&gt; and TwoVec&lt;f32, u8&gt; in the same program because u8 would be required to impl MarkerA for the former and MarkerB for the latter.\nIt took me quite a bit of fiddling to work around this issue. I tried lots of AsRef and deref-abuse shenanigans, some unstable features, lots of different things on both the TwoVec itself and on its constituent types. Many things kindof work, but require the fully qualified syntax which is... not preferable for obvious reasons. I have half an RFC written out of pure frustration titled negative_type_bounds. Being able to specify pub struct TwoVec&lt;A, B&gt; where A: !B (or type subsets like fn get&lt;T: A | B&gt;) would make this significantly easier. As far as I know, that sort of thing is trivial with C++'s templates.\nI found one way to make things work, and it's const generics (though there are lots of ways that don't work with const generics and unstable generic_const_expr, maybe a story for another day). By including a const bool type parameter on a trait implemented on each type A and B, we can differentiate between &lt;A, B&gt; where A is important and &lt;A, B&gt; where B is important. We can blanket-impl this trait to every Sized type:\n\nFrom there, it's possible to add a function get&lt;T, const Z: bool&gt; in TwoVec with the bound where T: Gettable&lt;A, B, Z&gt;. Not only does this restrict to only the exact types A and B of TwoVec&lt;A, B&gt;, it also does not conflict with TwoVec&lt;B, A&gt;, since that is an entirely different type from TwoVec&lt;A, B&gt;. Technically, when turbofishing get you're now required to also include the const bool parameter, but in most cases this is unnecessary because type inference removes the need for a turbofish at all.\nTo clarify further, since this is sorta spaghetti, here's an example. Say you have TwoVec&lt;u8, f32&gt;\n\nWhen asking for an Option&lt;u8&gt;, the compiler sees that u8 is Gettable for u8, f32, true, and the function signature requires a TwoVec&lt;u8, f32&gt;. There is no Gettable with u8, f32, false, as false is only cares about the B parameter, and u8 != f32. There is no other Gettable implementation for u8 with valid criteria, thus the const parameter true can be assumed\nTwoVec&lt;u8, f32&gt; impls cannot overlap with, say, TwoVec&lt;u8, i64&gt; because the B parameter of i64 (and the TwoVec&lt;u8, f32&gt; in the function signature) would place it in an entirely different monomorphization of Gettable\nThere is no self-overlap with TwoVec&lt;u8, u8&gt; because Gettable&lt;A, B, false&gt; and Gettable&lt;A, B, true&gt; are mutually exclusive (even though in this case they'd be completely interchangeable). Interestingly, type inference doesn't require us to turbofish on a TwoVec&lt;A, A&gt; even though both implementations would be valid. I'm not sure whether the compiler is choosing get::&lt;u8, true&gt;() or get::&lt;u8, false&gt;() or how it even makes the decision. Weird. Edit: Whoops, it definitely does ask for the generic parameter, not sure how I concluded otherwise.\n\nGrimy? Yes. Cool? Arguably.\nWe can even add a third impl that returns an either::Either, though this one feels even more gross since now the const parameter is truly meaningless (though it still must be a definite value for type inference to work)\n\nBit Fiddling#\n\nAs I mentioned above, debugging this nonsense is the worst. Typical debugger utilities are borderline worthless, so I have to check a lot of things by hand. As in notebook, pen, ascii table, and programming calculator, hand-translating whatever the debugger gave me into a slightly more useable form data at each step in the algorithm, drawing diagrams and painstakingly proving to myself each individual piece makes sense.\nI want to walk through the implementation of the remove function to give you guys an idea how much more fiddly this is compared to Vec functions. remove has to do two distinct tasks to work properly:\n\ncopy the data from the region offset_of_next_element..end_offset to the region offset_of_element..end_offset_minus_size_of_removed_element\ntake every bitfield-bit after the index and bitshift it left once\n\nThe first part is easy - we can copy the std::Vec implementation almost exactly. The only difference is that we can't just subtract \"1 element\" from the end offset, we have 2 different kinds of elements.\n\nThat shift_bits_down_after function call is carrying a lot of weight though. I always jump right to the bit fiddling solution, but I ended up messing it up on my first go-round. I took the time to make this slower, simpler function first to test against:\n\nBefore we get into the indexing math, I want to point out something small. In an effort to make debugging a little bit less painful the bit indexes are \"reversed\" so that the whole bitfield slice pretty-prints in order. That means the bit set to 1 in the expressions 1 &lt;&lt; 7 or 0b1000_0000 is at index 0. The clear_, set_ and get_ functions all follow this same pattern:\n\nTo lump multiple of these together into bit-shift operations, we need to handle 2 separate steps\n\nfor the byte that idx falls in, we need to left-shift only the bits after idx\nfor that byte and all (potential) following bytes, we need to fill the new \"blank\" right-most bit. The value that goes here is the left-most value of the next byte in the bitfield\n\nAs an aside, since the carry bit comes from the previous shift instruction, the most efficient way to handle this would probably be to iterate through the bitfield backwards. This is because the shift instructions automatically store the last-shifted-out-bit in a special, non-general-purpose register. Once there, it can be passed to the next operation for free - no register or stack usage required. On the other hand, computers aren't optimized for reverse-order array access, which typically wrecks the cache prefetch predictions. On the other other hand, that probably only matters if the bitfield is larger than a cache line (typically 64 bytes, which is 512 elements). On the other other other hand, it might be that the compiler can \"see through\" what I'm doing and rearrange the operations such that it uses the carry flag regardless of the order I read the array. For the sake of my sanity, I'm just going to iterate through it front to back.\n\nNext we need to isolate the 2 sets of bits we want - the bits before idx and the bits after idx. This is a bit trickier than it sounds though, since we also need to shift off idx itself. When shifting off the bottom bits, the naive shift amount might be 7 - (idx + 1), but this will panic if idx == 7 due to subtraction overflow. While we could do something like 7.saturating_sub(start_bit_idx + 1), this doesn't quite have the behavior we want. If idx == 7 and our byte is 0b0000_0001, the prior formula will give us a bitshift of 0 and our value won't change.\nWorkarounds for that like 7.checked_sub(start_bit_idx + 1).unwrap_or(1) or 7.saturating_sub(start_bit_idx + 1).max(1) only work when idx &gt; 0. When idx == 0, the only right-shift that would clear the top bit is 8. Unfortunately, shifting with a value that is &gt;= the bitwidth of your integer is UB.\nWhile we could make that a special case (if start_bit_idx != 0 {...} or checked_shr), it's easier to just shift it by the base amount, shift that value by 1, and then do the same in reverse. Alternatively, since we're dealing in non-usize values, we could cast the value to a larger size during the bit fiddling and then as cast it back to a u8 (which truncates it in rust) when it comes time to store the value. Casting more or less compiles to a noop so it's probably a smidge faster than 2 bitshifts.\n\nOne very important note: the cast to u8 for the pre index bits must be done after both shifts, since both shifts could overflow. The cast to u8 for the post index bits must be done before the second shift, because we need to truncate off the top bits before sliding everything back into place. I mistakenly did the truncation after both shifts and it took me an embarrassingly long time to spot.\nWith this done, we've effectively \"closed the gap\" by removing a bit, and the right-most bit in the pre- and post-idx values should be 0. Next we just need the carry bit, which can default to 0 if there is no next byte.\n\nand the resultant value is all 3 of those values masked together\n\nAnd finally, we can handle the rest of the bytes (if there are any) with a straightforward loop:\n\nAll of that just to accomplish the same feat as a single line in the Vec::remove implementation.\nLimitations#\n\nSpeed#\n\nLet's get this out of the way right away, on benchmarks pushing/reading/removing 10,000 random elements with random types, TwoVec is ~100x slower than Vec&lt;Enum&gt;.\n.idx_to_offset() - the primary driver for accessing the data - is technically O(N), but is really O(N/64) (yes I know how Big O works, but as far as I'm aware most people aren't adding an infinite number of elements to their vector so the coefficient still matters). This is after some optimizations. The original implementation looked something like this:\n\nEssentially, it takes the slice bitfield[..bitfield.len() - 1] and iterates over it, using .count_ones()/.count_zeroes() (which compile down to ~a single popcnt instruction) to determine how many of each type of element there is. A final special case has to be handled when idx doesn't fall on a byte boundary.\nThis code gets vectorized by the compiler. As it turns out though, the vectorized code is slightly suboptimal. In my benchmark, it ran a fair bit faster with #[inline(never)], but even that was slow. I'm not sure if it's the inherent performance characteristics of the vector instructions, the degenerate cases where the whole vector register is loaded up just to check 1 bit, the algorithm used to emulate popcnt behavior, or some other factor that I'm not considering. In any case, using \"shitty simd\", (i.e. treating a u64 as packed u8s) was about 20% faster on push and get for reasonable numbers of elements.\n\nI also tried u32-shitty-simd just in case, but that ended up being slower.\nThis could be improved by using run-length encoding, but that introduces some degenerate-case performance characteristics. If we store a reasonably-sized integer for the length, it'd use a ton more space when the type changes every single element. The worst possible case isn't a huge issue though, since at that point the end user should probably reach for Vec&lt;(A, B)&gt; instead.\nThere are potential bit-packing solutions that could offer a more reasonable tradeoff. For example, bit 1 indicates the type, the next 3 bits indicate the run length, and 2 of those are packed into each u8. That's a potential project for another day though.\nTraits#\n\nThose of you who muck around with pointers probably saw this coming. Notice that the get functions return owned objects, not references. This is the single biggest limitation of the container in my opinion.\nSince the values are packed in memory, there's no guarantee that they are aligned properly. It is always UB to have a &amp;T if T is unaligned. I'm hesitant to even have a function that hands out a raw pointers to T because it's so easy to do unaligned access wrong. I could use something like the unaligned crate and conditionally give out references when things happen to be aligned, but that comes with its own problems. Ideally I'd want the functions to be implemented on a trait, bounded by align_of::&lt;A&gt;() == align_of::&lt;B&gt;(), so the returned object is guaranteed to be aligned, but that requires const_generic_expr to be stabilized.\nAs a result, A and B are both required to be Copy. I left that detail out of the post until now mostly to make the signatures easier to read.\nIn the future, I may make an alternative \"alignment-aware\" version that ends up being a hybrid of TwoVec and Vec::Enum. It would only pad when necessary, so multiple small elements in a row could still be packed. Or, if ordering wasn't considered important, I could \"backfill\" the padding with new values.\nAdditionally, unlike Vec we cannot implement Deref or AsRef to anything else in any kind of sensible way because of how delicate and specialized the internal bookkeeping is. That severely limits the number of helper functions we can get \"for free\".\nSpace#\n\nWhile the storage overhead is typically much better than an enum, it's not guaranteed to be. The overhead varies based on how many elements are in the TwoVec and how large the size-difference is between types A and B. It has opposite storage characteristics to those of an enum - the overhead of an enum is worst when using mostly the small elements, whereas TwoVec stores the small variants much more efficiently, but can end up with a decent amount of wasted space when storing mostly large variants.\nBut why?#\n\nTo be clear, I don't think this container is very practical. If you find a usecase for it, please do not tell me. Whatever problem you're solving is unbelievably cursed and I don't want it anywhere near me.\nThis is mostly inspired by some of the jank workarounds I used when completing Advent of Code in C since I didn't want to implement hashmaps from scratch, and I didn't feel super comfortable with unions. TwoVec is a living example of something that I learned from C:\nStandard library types are a generalist solution that must be correct and useful in almost all cases. \"Almost all\" is not \"every\". There exists alternative ways of expressing your intent to the computer. In the same way that performance tuning is about informing the compiler about as many invariants as possible, sometimes it's okay to have a slightly gross data structure if it means it reflects your intentions better. In some cases, this also reduces the complexity of the final algorithm. Rules like \"one type per array\" or even \"all array elements must be the same size\" are just the tip of the iceberg. Calling them \"rules\" is itself sortof wrong. It's easy to forget that when reading discourse and advice about programming.\nIf I had to guess, I think that these sorts of \"one-off, highly specific, slightly gross\" data structures used to be more common back in the \"wild west\" days of programming. Back when hardware was much more limited, when languages and compilers were far less advanced, and when there was less \"common knowledge\" and \"best practices\" than we have today.\nThere are good reasons that they've fallen out of fashion - upkeep, readability, different performance priorities, etc. - but they shouldn't be considered non-options compared to generalized \"standard-library\"-esque data structures. Even if they're not necessary or practical, it still requires some lateral thinking and a deeper understanding of the language and underlying hardware. Those are always valuable skills to work on.\n","id":"https://walnut356.github.io/posts/twovec-a-very-silly-container/","title":"TwoVec: A Very Silly Container"},"https://walnut356.github.io/search/":{"body":"","id":"https://walnut356.github.io/search/","title":"Search"},"https://walnut356.github.io/tags/":{"body":"","id":"https://walnut356.github.io/tags/","title":"Tags"}},"docInfo":{"https://walnut356.github.io/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://walnut356.github.io/archive/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://walnut356.github.io/posts/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://walnut356.github.io/posts/estimate-playtime/":{"body":1429,"title":5},"https://walnut356.github.io/posts/language-documentation/":{"body":2464,"title":4},"https://walnut356.github.io/posts/lldbs-typesystems-an-unfinished-interface/":{"body":2536,"title":4},"https://walnut356.github.io/posts/lldbs-typesystems-pt-2/":{"body":3929,"title":5},"https://walnut356.github.io/posts/partial-borrow-pointer-ub/":{"body":3121,"title":10},"https://walnut356.github.io/posts/protoss-cost-efficiency/":{"body":3140,"title":5},"https://walnut356.github.io/posts/simulating-starcraft-p1/":{"body":2377,"title":6},"https://walnut356.github.io/posts/simulating-starcraft-p2/":{"body":1535,"title":6},"https://walnut356.github.io/posts/so-you-want-better-debug-info/":{"body":2573,"title":4},"https://walnut356.github.io/posts/space-time-complexity-tradeoff/":{"body":1059,"title":4},"https://walnut356.github.io/posts/syntax-test/":{"body":14,"title":2},"https://walnut356.github.io/posts/twovec-a-very-silly-container/":{"body":2195,"title":4},"https://walnut356.github.io/search/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://walnut356.github.io/tags/":{"body":0,"title":1}},"length":17},"lang":"English"}
